\section{OSX developer install}

These are the install instructions for OSX/developer.  If this isn't your operating system, or you want a developer install, go back to the \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#next_steps}{Cookbook} and select the correct link.


\subsection{Install Python}
First, you will need to download a scientific Python distribution.  We strongly recommend Anaconda.  Be warned, your computer comes with a version of Python already installed; but this pre-installed version does NOT have everything you will need to run {\bf PmagPy}, so you will still need to download Anaconda.

\begin{itemize}
\item Download and install \href{https://www.anaconda.com/download}{Anaconda Python 3}.  If you are running OSX Catalina or later, you MUST use the command line installer, not the graphical installer.
  \item Note: if you already installed Anaconda Python, and then you upgrade to OSX Catalina, you will need to reinstall Anaconda using the command line installer.
   \item Open your command line (Terminal).  See \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#command_line}{this Cookbook section} for more information on finding your command line.
   \item Download a few non-default Python packages.  Run the following commands: \begin{verbatim}

    conda install future cartopy pandas matplotlib
    conda install scripttest --channel conda-forge --no-deps
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    pip install wxpython 

\end{verbatim}
   \item When running these commands you may see some warnings about dependencies, but you can just ignore them!

\item If a package fails to install, you may need to use ``sudo'': i.e., \texttt{sudo pip install scripttest}.  You will then be asked for your computer password.

  \end{itemize}



\subsection{Test your python}


To make sure that you have installed Python successfully, type \texttt{python} on your command line.  You should see something like this: \begin{verbatim}

Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda custom (x86_64)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:04:09)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>\end{verbatim}
(Press control-D to exit)


\subsection{Install PmagPy}

Here are the steps to clone and install {\bf PmagPy}.

\begin{itemize}

  \item You must use bash as your shell (not csh, zsh, etc.). This is the default for OSX, so if you have set up a different shell you will need to switch back.  Select Terminal \verb!-->! Preferences \verb!-->! General, and choose ``default login shell''.  Restart Terminal, and you'll be ready to go.

\item Download and \href{https://git-scm.com/downloads}{install git}

  \item Navigate to the directory where you want to put the PmagPy folder, then run:

\begin{verbatim}

  git clone https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy.git
\end{verbatim}

\item You should now have a full local copy of the PmagPy repository.  Change directories into PmagPy:

\begin{verbatim}

  cd PmagPy
\end{verbatim}

\item Next, you need to add PmagPy to your PATH so that the PmagPy programs can be called from any directory. Try running:

\begin{verbatim}

  python dev_setup.py install
\end{verbatim}

\item If you have problems with the install, run \verb!python dev_setup.py -h! for more information.  You can also set your \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#setting_path}{PATH manually} if dev\_setup.py fails.

\item After completing the developer install, you should restart your command line.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test PmagPy}

Test core functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item On your command line, type ``python'' to start the interpreter.  You will import pmagpy and then run a simple calculation.  Importing pmagpy may take over a minute the first time, so be patient!  It will be much faster in subsequent runs.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from pmagpy import pmag
>>> pmag.angle([350.0,10.0],[320.0,20.0])
array([30.59060998])
>>>
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

Test the GUIs:

\begin{itemize}
\item  On the command line, open Pmag GUI by running:

\begin{verbatim}
pmag_gui.py
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

If any of these commands don't work, go back and carefully follow the install instructions.  If you still have a problem, try the \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#trouble}{Troubleshooting section}.  If you don't find an answer there, check out the existing \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues}{Github issues} and create a new one if necessary.

\subsection{Finishing up}

Accessing example data files:

   There are many data files used in the examples of programs and for use with the textbook  \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3.html}{Essentials of Paleomagnetism}.  You can find these in PmagPy/data_files.


\subsection{Keeping PmagPy up-to-date}

    You will want to stay up to date with {\bf PmagPy} development.  To update your developer install, you will just need to navigate to the {\bf PmagPy} directory and run:

\begin{verbatim}
    git pull
\end{verbatim}

This will grab all of the latest code from \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy}{Github}, and will be immediately available to you.
