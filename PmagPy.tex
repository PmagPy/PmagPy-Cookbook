 \title{PmagPy Cookbook}

 \maketitle
\noindent Dear Reader,

This documentation is updated from that in the book entitled {\it Essentials of Paleomagnetism} by  Tauxe et al., (2010). \nocite{tauxe10}  This cookbook was designed as a companion website to the book \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3.html}{Essentials of Paleomagnetism, 4th Web Edition}. Chapter references to this companion book are, for example, ``Essentials Chapter 1''.

There are many chefs who contributed to this work, in particular, the MagIC Database Team (Cathy Constable, Anthony Koppers, Rupert Minnett, Nick Jarboe, Ron Shaar, and Lori Jonestrask). Nick Swanson-Hysell (UC Berkeley) contributed the demag\_gui and Jupyter notebook documentation. The PmagPy project is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation.

A pdf version of this cookbook is available for download at:  \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Cookbook/blob/gh-pages/PmagPy.pdf}{PmagPy.pdf}.

Users of PmagPy should cite the open access article:

\chapter{Installing {\bf PmagPy}}

%To skip all the details and just start using \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} or \href{#magic_gui.py}{MagIC GUI} to upload data into the \href{#MagICDatabase}{MagIC database}, or to analyze using \href{#thellier_GUI.py}{Thellier GUI} or \href{#DemagGUI}{Demag GUI}, start here.
You have a few options for downloading and using PmagPy.  If you only want to try Pmag/Magic GUIs, you can download both of them as  \href{#standalone}{standalone programs}.
  If you want full access to PmagPy functionality, you must first install the recommended version of
   \href{#getting_python}{ Python}.
   Then  \href{#pip_install}{use the pip utility} to download/install several {PmagPy} modules.

\customlink{standalone}
\section{Standalone GUI download}

If you do not need the full PmagPy functionality, and you only want to use Pmag GUI, MagIC GUI, Thellier GUI, and Demag GUI, there is now a standalone download for you.  You won't need to install Python for this.
You can download the \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest}{standalone applications for OSX here}, and \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-Windows/releases/latest}{for Windows here}.

Follow the download instructions in the provided links, and then you can skip the ``Full install'' section and go straight to using \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} or \href{#magic_gui.py}{MagIC GUI}.  The standalone versions of these applications are still in development; please report problems to the PmagPy team: \href{mailto:ltauxe@ucsd.edu}{ltauxe@ucsd.edu}.

\subsection{OSX Standalone download}

To get started, download the zip file and put the resulting folder on your desktop. Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will have one folder each for Pmag GUI and MagIC GUI. Open the appropriate folder and double click the icon (depending on your security settings, you may have to right click the icon and then select ``ok'' the first time you open it).

You'll find the latest stable release at:

\noindent  \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest}{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest}


\subsection{Windows Standalone download}
In order to install this software, you will need to download and install \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29}{Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package}. This provides some backend dependencies that let our software run.

Next, get started by downloading the zip file (see links below) and putting the resulting folder on your desktop. You'll need to ``extract all'' files. Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will find icons for installing Pmag GUI and MagIC GUI. Double click the program you wish to use and you will be guided the the install process.

You'll find the latest stable release at:

\noindent   \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-Windows/releases/latest}{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-Windows/releases/latest}


\customlink{full_install}
\section{Full PmagPy install}

To get the full  use of PmagPy functionality, you will first have to install Python.

\customlink{getting_python}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Download and install the \href{https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/}{Enthought Canopy distribution of Python}. Canopy Express (the free version) contains everything you need (except the mapping utilities). If you are at a degree-granting educational institution you can request an \href{https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/academic/}{academic license} that gives you access to additional features and bundled packages, including the Basemap package.
   \item Launch Canopy to complete the installation process.  You may need to use control click on the Canopy icon to open it for the first time--try this if you get a message that says ``Canopy can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.''  Once you've opened Canopy successfully, select ``yes'' to making Canopy your default Python environment.  In the lower right hand corner of the Canopy launch page, you will find the Version number (currently 1.6.1 or higher). Please include this in any correspondence with the PmagPy team. While you might find use for some of the features within the Canopy environment that opens as an application, PmagPy programs are best run or launched on the \href{#command_line}{command line}.
      \item {Optional:   Setting up Basemap for use in making maps with Python}
Once you have installed the full version of Canopy and want to use the mapping programs (e.g., \href{#basemap_magic.py}{basemap\_magic.py}), \customlink{HighRes}
     click on  the `Package Manager' button on the Canopy welcome page, and then on `Available Packages'.  Install both basemap packages (one has high resolution data files in it).
        \item A last note about Canopy: you should update it regularly!  Open the Canopy application and update the packages at least every few months.
   \end{itemize}
% \subsection{Getting Python for Windows users}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item To use the full functionality PmagPy functionality, you will need to download the most recent Enthought Python Distribution (EPD).  If you are at a degree-granting educational institution you can request an \href{https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/academic/}{academic license}, which gives access to this distribution.
%   \item Once you have registered and gotten your academic license, you can \href{https://store.enthought.com/repo/epd/installers/epd-7.5-2-win-x86_64.msi}{download EPD here}.
%   \item Windows users who cannot get an academic license should install this \href{http://magician.ucsd.edu/Software/PmagPy/archive/epd-7.3-2-win-x86.msi}{older Enthought Distribution}.  This version of EPD will not support all PmagPy programs, so if you want to run Pmag GUI or MagIC GUI you should download the \href{#standalone}{standalone versions}.
%   \item If you run into problems with your installation, you may need to uninstall any previous Python installations.
%   \end{itemize}

 \subsection{Installing PmagPy}

 Here we provide instructions for using pip to install PmagPy from the command line.
    \customlink{pip_install}
       ``Pip'' is a package manager that comes standard with any modern Python distribution (NB: you will have to update it to the most recent version).  Pip allows you to install and uninstall pmagpy, the package with all the low-level functionality of PmagPy and pmagpy-cli which provides the PmagPy command-line-interface and has all the packages you may use to download/upload, visualize, and manipulate data.


  To install using pip:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Find  and open your \href{#command_line}{command line}.
      \item Update pip: type on  the command line: \begin{verbatim}pip install --upgrade pip\end{verbatim}
     \item Install or update pmagpy: use the command: \begin{verbatim}pip install --upgrade pmagpy \end{verbatim}
     \item Install or update pmagpy-cli, use the command: \begin{verbatim}pip install --upgrade pmagpy-cli \end{verbatim}
     \item To uninstall either, use the command: ``pip uninstall pmagpy'' or ``pip uninstall pmagpy-cli''
     \item If you run into trouble, use pip to uninstall both pmagpy and pmagpy-cli, then try again to install first pmagpy and then pmagpy-cli
   \end{itemize}

%
%
%To install from the Github software repository:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Download the zip file from the \href{https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy/releases/latest} {PmagPy} software package on Github. Unzip the downloaded file by double clicking on it. PC users should extract all the files to a folder on your desktop (or wherever).  Once you have the folder open, double click on the {\it install\_MacOS} or {\it install\_Windows} file depending on your operating system.  (If you are a Linux user, just copy the files to some directory and put both PmagPy and PmagPy/programs into your path.)
%   \item For Windows users, the install process will create a custom ``PmagPy Prompt'' with a shortcut on your desktop.  This prompt is identical to the regular Command Prompt, except that it has all of the PmagPy functionality built in. From here on, whenever the documentation refers to your ``command line'', you should use the PmagPy Prompt.
%    \end{itemize}
%
%

   \subsection{Finishing up}

    Now your installation should be complete.  There are a few more details:
    \begin{itemize}
\item Testing your installation:

To make sure everything is working, return to your \href{#command_line}{command line} (or PmagPy Prompt), type {\bf eqarea.py -h}.      Important note for Windows users: you will need to use ``eqarea -h''.  In fact, you will drop the ``.py'' anytime you are calling a command-line program.

 If you do not see the help message, first try setting your path by hand following the instructions on the  \href{#trouble}{Trouble Shooting} page. If that fails, please send the error message and  Canopy version number to \href{mailto:ltauxe@ucsd.edu?subject=PmagPy Cookbook}{ltauxe@ucsd.edu}

\item Accessing example data files:

   There are many data files used in the examples of programs and for use with the textbook  \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3.html}{Essentials of Paleomagnetism}.     You may want to copy  the data files to your Desktop or another convenient location.
   To do this, navigate on the command line to your destination folder (for help, see \href{#file_system}{this section}).  Then, use the command: \begin{verbatim}move_data_files.py -d .\end{verbatim} This will copy all of the PmagPy example files to your current directory (represented by ``.'').

\customlink{hires}
\item Installing the Etopo20 package for use with Basemap:

To install the Etopo20 package, see \href{#install_etopo.py}{install\_etopo.py}.

   \end{itemize}

%\item Move the  Datafiles  folder from your {\bf PmagPy} folder and place it somewhere (e.g., your Desktop) with no spaces in the path.
%Create a \href{#Project_Directory}{MagIC Project Directory}.
%Find your \href{#command_line}{command line} to launch any {\bf PmagPy} process.

%
% \section{Pip PmagPy install (beta)}
% We are moving to a build system that uses the ``pip'' utility exclusively, see details below.
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item 1.  Download and install Python.
%   \item 2.  Find your command prompt.
%   \item 3.  Upgrade pip.
%   \item 4.  Install pmagpy and pmagpy-cli.
%   \item 5.  Test that your install is complete.
% \end{itemize}
%
%\begin{itemize}

\customlink{pmag_gui.py}

\chapter{Pmag GUI Tutorial}
\label{chap:Pmag GUI}

{\bf Pmag GUI} is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) written by Lori Jonestrask and Ron Shaar  that provides a quick path to the main {\bf PmagPy} programs. The work flow is illustrated schematically here:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigQkMagicFlow.eps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Follow the steps in the \href{#quick_start}{Installing PmagPy} section.

\customlink{Project_Directory}

\item  When you invoke {\bf Pmag GUI}, the first step is to change directories into a  `Project Directory'. For each study, create a directory with a name that relates to that study. Here we will call it {\it ThisProject}.  This is where you will collect and process all the rock and paleomagnetic data for a given study, usually a publication. The project directory name should have NO SPACES and be placed on the hard drive in a place that has NO spaces in the path. Under certain Windows versions, this means you should not use your home directory, but create a directory called for example: D:$\backslash$MyPmagProjects and put {\it ThisProject} there.
%
%Inside the  {\it ThisProject} directory, create two additional directories: {\it MyFiles} and {\it MagIC}. All the files that you want to convert to the MagIC format should be placed in {\it MyFiles}.  The {\it Project Directory} that {\bf Pmag GUI} seeks is that {\it MagIC} directory.
%
%Your Directory tree might look like this now:
%
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/ProjectDirectory.eps}


 \item \textbf{copy example files:}  In the {\it data\_files } folder you will find a subfolder named {\it Pmag\_GUI}. Copy the contents of the  \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory  into  your  own \href{#Project_Directory}{Project Directory} folder.
 \item Start Pmag GUI either by typing {\bf pmag\_gui.py} on your \href{#command_line}{command line}, or (if you have the \href{#standalone}{standalone}), by double-clicking the Pmag GUI icon on your Desktop.
 \item Change directories by clicking  on the ``change dir'' button and select your own {\it ThisProject} directory.
 \end{enumerate}

 \customlink{convert2magic}

\section{Converting magnetometer files to MagIC format}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Pmag GUI} allows for converting many different laboratory formats.  For the complete set of instructions, see the section on \href{#magnetometer_files}{Supported Rock Magnetometer files}.   For this example, we will use a `generic' file format.
%rshaar% In the {\it MyFiles} folder there are  files containing AF, Thermal, and Thellier measurement data of samples from location Snake River (lava flow site). All samples are from site sr01. The measurement data are arranged in the generic format.
An example for a generic file format is shown here:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigGenericFormat.eps}

To learn what all the column headers mean look at the documentation for \href{#generic_magic.py}{generic\_magic.py}.

%\item Locate the {\it MyFiles} folder in  the {\it Datafiles} subdirectory named {\it Pmag GUI} and copy the contents to your own {\it MyFiles} directory.
%
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigMyFiles.eps}

%\item Run the program: Open up a terminal window (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and type pmag_gui.py on the command line. In the Pmag GUI main panel press the Õchange dirÕ button. Select the MagIC directory in ThisProject when prompted.

\item In your  \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory  there are three files with AF, Thermal, and Thellier measurement data of specimens from site sr01 (a lava flow site) of \cite{tauxe04b}.  There is also a file with sample orientation, location and other metadata typical for a paleomagnetic study.
\item Press the [Convert magnetometer files to MagIC format] button. If no menu pops up or the window is blank, click on the Python icon  (the little space ship) on your dock. You should see a dialog window will appear with different file formats:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigChooseFile.eps}

\item  Click on  `generic format'  and press the  [import file] button.  A new dialog box will appear. For more details click on the [help] button.
\item  In the dialog box, click on the [Add] button and choose one of the measurements files.
\item  Optional: Insert your EarthRef user name.
\item Choose your experiment type from the dropdown list.

\item Choose specimen-sample naming convention.  In this example, specimen sr01a1 belongs to sample sr01a so the specimen-sample naming convention is  `no. of terminal characters ' and the delimiter/number field is `1' ).
\item Choose sample-site naming convention.  In this example, sample sr01a belongs to site sr01 so the sample-site naming convention is  `no. of terminal characters' with a delimiter/number of  `1'.
\item  Fill in the \href{#MagICDatabase}{EarthRef Location Name}  for this project .  For this project, it is ``Snake River''.
\customlink{location_name}

\item Note:  a location is a stratigraphic section,  a sampling region,  an drill core, and so on.  MagIC doesn't really care what your location name is, but use the same location name every time you are asked for it, because it really ties your dataset together and is required within the data model.

Your dialog boxes should look like this for the AF and thermal data:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigConvertGenericA.eps}

and like this for the  paleointensity data.  For paleointensity data, you must also supply the lab field in micro tesla (40) and orientation relative to sample's X direction:  0 90.

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigConvertGenericB.eps}

\item Press OK to create a new MagIC measurement file, which is saved in your \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory.


\customlink{Combine}

\item After converting all files to MagIC format, press the [Next Step] button in the `convert magnetometer files' dialog box. All files with the .magic suffix will be added to the list.  [You can edit the list by deleting unwanted files or adding additional MagIC formatted files.]   You should see a list of the three magic files:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigCombineMagic.eps}

\item Click the OK button. The three files will be combined to a single file,  named {\it magic\_measurements.txt} and also stored  in your \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory.
\end{itemize}

\customlink{orient}

\section{Optional: Calculate geographic / tilt-corrected direction}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Pmag GUI} provides an optional tool for calculating geographic and tilt-corrected directions if those directions were not part of the original data files. To use this tool click on the button labeled `calculate geographic/tilt-corrected directions'.

\item An empty template of a file named SrExample\_orient.txt was created in the MagIC Project Directory. This file is displayed in a Python window. You can fill in  this file manually using the Python window or \href{#field_info}{with with a spreadsheet program} (recommended). The empty template has now only the sample names derived from your measurement files, using the naming rules that you chose.
\item To see an example of a filled in one, pull down the menu bar [file] $\rightarrow$  [open orientation file] and  choose the file SrExample\_orient.txt from {\it MyFiles} folder.
\item Choose from the menu bar [file] $\rightarrow$ [Save orientation file].
\item Choose from the menu bar [file] $\rightarrow$ [Calculate sample orientation].
\item Fill in the dialog box like this:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigDemagOrient.eps}

\begin{itemize}
\item Orientation convention :Pomeroy.
\item Declination correction: Use the IGRF.
\item  Orientation priority: \#1.
\item Put in the number of hours to SUBTRACT from the local time to get to Greenwich Mean Time: -6. [Local time was 6 hours behind GMT for this example.]
\item press the OK button.
\end{itemize}
\item In the next dialog window add the additional information:
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/FigOrientMagicCodes.eps}

\section{Filling in the EarthRef data}

Filling in the Earth Ref data is a critical part of building a MagIC Project Directory. The Earth-Ref data relevant to this example are arranged in five er\_* tables: er\_specimens, er\_samples, er\_sites, er\_locations, er\_ages. To complete the  ER data, click the button, and follow the directions in the help window in order:

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 0: Choose the appropriate headers for each of your er\_* tables.  Required headers (or headers already present in your er\_* tables) show up in the top box, optional headers in the bottom.  In our example, the only header you should add is ``age\_sigma'' in the age table.  Once you have added all needed headers, click the OK button to proceed to the next step.

 \includegraphics[width=30cm]{EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep0.eps}

 \item The next six steps contain editable grids.  For many columns, you can edit using drop-down menus that provide \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/shortlists.htm}{controlled vocabularies}.  For others, you must manually enter data into the cell.  A single left click will bring up a drop-down menu; a double-left click will call up the cell editor.  With both types of data entry, it is possible to select a single value for the entire column. Simply click on the column label.  If that column has a drop-down menu, you can then click on any cell in the column, the appropriate menu will pop up, and the value you select will propagate throughout the column.  Edits in that column will continue to be global until you select another column to edit or you de-select the column by clicking on the column label again.  If you select a column that does not have a drop-down menu, a text entry dialog will pop up, and the value you provide will be applied to the column.

 \item Step 1: Update the relationship between specimens and samples.  You may not rename specimens, but you may reassign them to a different sample.  It is also possible to add additional samples, using the 'Add new sample' button.  Note that specimen\_type, specimen\_lithology, and specimen\_class columns do not show up.  They will propagate down when you select sample\_type, sample\_lithology, and sample\_class in step 4.

 \includegraphics[width=16cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep1.eps}

\item Step 2:  Update the relationship between samples and sites.  You may rename samples, or you can reassign them to a different site.  You can also add additional sites using the ``Add a new site`` button.  You will be able to update other columns in the er\_samples file in step 4.

 \includegraphics[width=16cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep2.eps}

\item Step 3: Update the relationship between sites and locations.  You may rename sites, or you can reassign them to a different location.  You can add additional locations using the ``Add a new location'' button.  You must choose a legal entry from the \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/shortlists.htm}{controlled vocabularies} for the following headers: ``site\_class'', ``site\_lithology'', ``site\_type''. You may combine more than one controlled vocabulary by making them a colon delimited list.  If you select a value in these categories: class, lithology, type, longitude, or latitude, the values will propagate to the samples table.  In this example,  site\_class=Extrusive:Igneous; site\_lithology=Basaltic Lava; site\_type=Lava Flow

\includegraphics[width=32cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep3.eps}

\item Step 4: Some data from sites in Step 3 have propagated into the samples table.  You may update and fill in all columns in the samples table here.

\includegraphics[width=32cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep4.eps}

\item Step 5: Fill in information for locations.  If you have provided site latitudes and longitudes, the columns for beginning and ending latitudes and longitudes should be filled in already. You must choose a legal entry from the \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/shortlists.htm}{controlled vocabularies} for the  ``location\_type''. In this example: location\_type = outcrop.

\includegraphics[width=32cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep5.eps}

\item Step 6: Fill in columns with any necessary information.   In this example, age=3.4; age\_sigma=0.03 (not a default header); age\_unit=Ma (from controlled vocabularies), magic\_method\_codes  = GM-ARAR-AP (from \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/shortlists.htm}{controlled vocabularies}). It means ``40Ar/39Ar age determination: Age plateau.''

\includegraphics[width=32cm] {EPSfiles/FigErMagicStep6.eps}

\item Note that if you re-run this sequence, certain values may be changed or overwritten.  For example, if you set sample\_lithology to be something different from site\_lithology, re-running ErMagic will cause sample\_lithology to revert back to being the same as site\_lithology.
\item You are now ready to move on to making some interpretations!


\end{itemize}

\customlink{DemagGUI}

\section{Demag GUI quick start}
\label{sect:demag_gui}

This image shows the main panel of the demag GUI:

\includegraphics[width=30cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui.eps}

Use of the Demag GUI is described in more detail in the \href{#demag_gui.py}{Demag GUI} section below. Here are a few instructions that can be used as a quick start for using Demag GUI.

To analyze the data in the example, follow these steps for each specimen:
\begin{itemize}
\item From the `coordinate system' drop-down menu you can choose the coordinate system in which you wish to view the data (e.g.  `geographic').
\item Click `add a fit' and choose the temperature/AF bounds for the fit by double clicking on the measurement lines or by choosing from the `bounds' dropdown menu.
\item Click the `next' button to analyze the next specimen.
\item To calculate  Fisher mean for the site: choose from the `higher level mean' drop-down menus: show=specimens; mean=Fisher.
\item All of the fits can be viewed and modified using the Interpretation Editor which can be selected from the Tools menu in the top menubar.
\item To save all of the specimen interpretations, choose from the menubar [File] $\rightarrow$ [Save MagIC pmag tables]. This saves all the interpretations in MagIC formatted pmag\_* files in your \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory. Fits that are saved this way will be loaded into demag\_gui the next time it is launched.
\item Click through the dialog boxes and fill out choices for the MagIC results table.
\item Close the Demag GUI.

\section{Thellier GUI quick start}
This image shows the main panel of \href{#ThellierGUI}{Thellier GUI}:

\includegraphics[width=30cm]{EPSfiles/FigThellierGui.eps}

Use of the Thellier GUI is described in more detail in the \href{#thellier_GUI.py}{Thellier GUI} section below and in this PDF document: \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Cookbook/blob/gh-pages/thellier_GUI_full_manual.pdf}{Thellier GUI manual}. Here are a few instructions that can be used as a quick start for using Thellier GUI.

To analyze the data in the example, follow these steps for each specimen:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Choose temperature bounds from the temperatures dropdown menus.
\item  Click `save' so the program remembers the interpretations (the interpretation is not saved to a file yet!).
\item  Click the `next' button to analyze the next specimen.
\item The default of the program is to calculate sample means. To change it to site level mean, choose from the menubar: [Analysis $\rightarrow$ [Acceptance criteria] $\rightarrow$  [Change acceptance criteria]. Find the `average by sample/site' dropdown menu in the third row and change it to [site]. Click OK. The site mean will appear in the sample/site results box (top right).
\item  After all specimen interpretations are saved in memory, choose from the menubar [File] $\rightarrow$ [Save MagIC pmag tables]. This save all the interpretations in MagIC formatted pmag\_* files in the MagIC Project Directory.
\item  Close the Thellier GUI.
\end{itemize}

\customlink{magic_upload}

\section{Upload to the database }

For this, you first click on the green {\it prepare upload txt file} button on the main page of {\bf Pmag GUI}. A file named `upload.txt' will be created in your \href{#Project_Directory}{\it ThisProject} directory.  Now, go to the  \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/search}{MagIC search interface}.      Click on the `create' button and find or create your reference.

Click on `Upload' in the Actions column and   drag and drop the {\it upload.txt}   file onto the  `Drop a MagIC Text File' window.
Congratulations. Your data are now in the database.  But, they are not yet activated which you can do by clicking on the `Activate' button in the Actions column.  Once you activate an uploaded dataset (only for published papers), it will be publicly available.

\customlink{magic_download}

\section{Downloading data from {\bf MagIC}}

Data can be downloaded from the {\bf MagIC} database and examined with {\bf PmagPy} tools.   The \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/search/}{\bf MagIC} search interface provides a rich variety of search filters available by clicking on the `Filter the MagIC Search Results' text box.    To locate data from a particular reference,  simply substitute the digital object identifier (DOI) in your browser window:

\href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/doi/10.1029/2003GC000661}{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/doi/10.1029/2003GC000661}

\noindent The above DOI will find the data for the paper by \cite{tauxe04b}.  [This may fail in Safari; if so, use an alternative browser like Firefox or Chrome.]     To download the data, simply click on the file icon below the column labeled `data'.  This will save a file to your downloads folder.
 To unpack this file after downloading it from the database click the ``unpack downloaded txt file button`` in the \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}  panel.


 \section{Preparing for MagIC}

\customlink{field_info}

\subsection{Field and sampling information}

 There is an astounding number of different ways that paleomagnetists document data in the field and in the lab. This variety is met with a large number  of method codes that describe sampling and orientation procedures (see \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/methods.htm} for a complete description).   The MagIC database expects sample orientations to be the azimuth and plunge of the fiducial arrow used for measurement (see  \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch2.html#ch2}{[Essentials, Chapter 9]} )  and the orientation of the bedding to be dip direction and downward dip so no matter what your own preference is, it must be translated into the standard MagIC convention for use with the PmagPy programs and with \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.

\href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}  supports two different ways of getting orientation and other sampling related information into a MagIC usable format.  The first way is through \href{#orient}{step 2 on the GUI front panel} and filling in the data from within the GUI.  That way will work for many applications, but it may be desirable to fill the spreadsheet in separately from the GUI by using  a tab delimited file (orient.txt format).   By clicking on  \href{#orient}{step 2 on the GUI front panel}  you create a file named {\it demag\_orient.txt}  which has all of your sample names in it.   Each {\it orient.txt} file should  have all the information for a single location {\it sensu MagIC}.


  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orient.eps}

 The next row has the names of the columns.  The required columns are:  sample\_name, mag\_azimuth, field\_dip, date, lat, long, sample\_lithology, sample\_type, sample\_class) but there are a number of other possible columns (e.g., Optional Fields in orient.txt formatted files are: [date, shadow\_angle, hhmm], date, stratigraphic\_height, [bedding\_dip\_direction, bedding\_dip], [image\_name, image\_look, image\_photographer], participants, method\_codes, site\_name, and site\_description, GPS\_Az]).  Column names in brackets must be supplied together and the data for stratigraphic\_height are in meters.  Also note that if these are unoriented samples, just set mag\_azimuth and field\_dip to 0.

% If there is a simple  and consistent relationship between the site name and the sample name (e.g., sample ns034a belongs to site ns034), you do not need to specify a site name here as it will be parsed by \href{#orientation_magic.py}{orientation\_magic.py} when it gets converted  to the MagIC format.  However, many investigators have no such consistent naming scheme.  Moreover, in some cases,  groups of samples or initial site designations need to be re-grouped for averaging.  For example, if it becomes clear that a sequence of lava flows were erupted over a short period of time and should be averaged together, you would need a new site name for all the samples.  Note that there are different understandings of the term {\bf site} in the paleomagnetic community.  We adhere to the MagIC definition of ``site'', which is:
% \begin{quote}
%site: a group of samples that are homogeneous with respect to the property being measured.
%\end{quote}
%\noindent When a site  has no simple relationship to the sample names, a column named  site\_name in the {\it orient.txt} file can be used  with the site name filled in for every sample.

   It is handy  to document the lithology, type and material classification information required by MagIC. These  are all controlled vocabularies listed at \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/shortlists.htm}.   For archaeological materials, set the lithology to ``Not Specified''.

   Put in stratigraphic height, sun compass, differential GPS orientation information under the appropriate column headings.  You can also flag a particular sample orientation as suspect, by having a column 'sample\_flag' and setting it to either 'g' for good or 'b' for bad.  Other options include documenting digital field photograph names and who was involved with the sampling.

 For Sun Compass measurements, supply the shadow\_angle, date and time. The date must be in mm/dd/yy format. If you enter the time in local time, be sure you know the offset to Universal Time as you will have to supply that when you import the file. Also, only put data from one time zone in a single file. The shadow angle should follow the convention shown in this figure (from Tauxe et al., 2010): \nocite{tauxe10}

  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/suncomp.eps}

  \customlink{orientation_schemes}

{\bf Supported sample orientation schemes:}

  There are options for
 different orientation conventions (drill direction with the Pomeroy orientation device  [drill azimuth and hade] is the default), different naming conventions and a choice of whether to automatically calculate the IGRF value for magnetic declination correction, supply your own or ignore the correction.  The program generates {\it er\_samples.txt} and {er\_sites.txt} files.  Be warned that existing files with these names will be overwritten.

 All images, for example outcrop photos are supplied as a separate zip file. image\_name is the name of the picture you will import, image\_look is the ``look direction`` and image\_photographer is the person who took the picture. This information will be put in a file named er\_images.txt and will ultimately be read into the er\_image table in the console where additional information must be entered (keywords, etc.).

Often, paleomagnetists note when a sample orientation is suspect in the field. To indicate that a particular sample may have an uncertainty in its orientation that is greater than about 5$^{\circ}$, enter SO-GT5 in the method\_codes column and any other special codes pertaining to a particular sample from the method codes table. Other general method codes can be entered later. Note that unlike date and sample\_class, the method codes entered in orient.txt pertain only to the sample on the same line.

Samples are oriented in the field with a ``field arrow`` and measured in the laboratory with a ``lab arrow``. The lab arrow is the positive X direction of the right handed coordinate system of the specimen measurements. The lab and field arrows may not be the same. In the MagIC database, we require the orientation (azimuth and plunge) of the X direction of the measurements (lab arrow). Here are some popular conventions that convert the field arrow azimuth (mag\_azimuth in the orient.txt file) and dip (field\_dip in orient.txt) to the azimuth and plunge of the laboratory arrow (sample\_azimuth and sample\_dip in er\_samples.txt). The two angles, mag\_azimuth and field\_dip are explained below.

{\parindent 0pt
[1] Standard Pomeroy convention of azimuth and hade (degrees from vertical down) of the drill direction (field arrow). sample\_azimuth = mag\_azimuth; sample\_dip =-field\_dip.

  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_1.eps}

  2] Field arrow is the strike of the plane orthogonal to the drill direction, Field dip is the hade of the drill direction. Lab arrow azimuth = mag\_azimuth-90$^{\circ}$; Lab arrow dip = -field\_dip

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_2.eps}

  [3] Lab arrow is the same as the drill direction; hade was measured in the field. Lab arrow azimuth = mag\_azimuth; Lab arrow dip = 90$^{\circ}$-field\_dip.

      \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_3.eps}

  [4] Lab arrow orientation same as mag\_azimuth and field\_dip.

        \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_4.eps}

        [5]  Lab arrow azimuth is  mag\_azimuth and lab arrow dip is the  field\_dip-90$^{\circ}$

               \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_5.eps}


 [6] Lab arrow azimuth is mag\_azimuth-90$^{\circ}$, Lab arrow dip is 90$^{\circ}$-field\_dip, i.e., the field arrow was strike and dip of orthogonal face:

                \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/orcon_6.eps}
                }

{\bf Structural correction conventions:}


Because of the ambiguity of strike and dip, the MagIC database uses the dip direction and dip where dip is positive from 0 $\rightarrow$ 180. Dips$ > $90 are overturned beds.


 \customlink{naming_schemes}

{\bf Supported sample naming schemes:}

\begin{verbatim}
            [1] XXXXY: where XXXX is an arbitrary length site designation and Y
                is the single character sample designation.  e.g., TG001a is the
                first sample from site TG001.    [default]
            [2] XXXX-YY: YY sample from site XXXX (XXX, YY of arbitary length)
            [3] XXXX.YY: YY sample from site XXXX (XXX, YY of arbitary length)
            [4-Z] XXXX[YYY]:  YYY is sample designation with Z characters from site XXX
            [5] site name = sample name
            [6] site name entered in site_name column in the orient.txt format input file
            [7-Z] [XXX]YYY:  XXX is site designation with Z characters from samples  XXXYYY
\end{verbatim}

When you are finished with editing the {\it orient.txt} file,  return to  \href{#orient}{step 2 on the GUI front panel}.

%\customlink{AZDIP}
%
%\subsubsection{AZDIP formatted files}
%
%This is a very simple file format with the sample name Azimuth Plunge Strike Dip where the Azimuth and Plunge are of the drill direction (Specimen's Z direction) or orientation convention \#3 above to convert to the MagIC standard. To convert strike to bedding dip direction, we would just add 90$^{\circ}$. Here is an example AzDip file:
%

\customlink{LIMS}

\subsubsection{Data files downloaded from the IODP (LIMS) database}


There are two types of files that help in plotting of IODP paleomagnetic data sets: the core summaries with depth to core top information and the sample information that contains lists of samples taken.
Visiting the IODP science query website at \url{http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/WTR/html/sci-data.html} allows you to
select 'SRM - Remanence of magnetization' under the Analysis scroll down menu.  By picking the expedition, site, hole, etc. you can download a  .csv format (comma separated values) for the expedition data.  (Be aware that this is the rawest form of the data, including disturbed intervals, bad measurements, core ends, etc. and may not be exactly what ended up getting published!).   First click on the ``Show Report`` button, then, ``Expand Table'', then ``Get File'':

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/WebTabular_srm.eps}

This can take a very long time, so get yourself a cup of tea.

You can also (while you're at it) click on the 'Summaries' tab and download the coring summaries:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/WebTabular_core.eps}

Place both of the downloaded files in your {\it MyFiles} directory.


\customlink{magnetometer_files}

\subsection{Supported Rock Magnetometer files}

The MagIC database is designed to accept data from a wide variety of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic experiments. Because of this the magic\_measurements table is complicated. Each measurement only makes sense in the context of what happened to the specimen before measurement and under what conditions the measurement was made (temperature, frequency, applied field, specimen orientation, etc). Also, there are many different kinds of instruments in common use, including rock magnetometers, susceptibility meters, Curie balances, vibrating sample and alternating gradient force magnetometers, and so on. We have made an effort to write translation programs for the most popular instrument and file formats and continue to add new supported formats as the opportunity arises. Here we describe the various supported data types and tell you how to prepare your files for importing. In general, all files for importing should be placed in the MyFiles directory or in subdirectories therein as needed.  If you don't see your data type in this list, please send an example file and a request to:  ltauxe@ucsd.edu and we'll get it in there for you.


The supported file formats are:

{\bf Rock Magnetometer Files:}

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\customlink{Hysteresis_file_formats}

\subsubsection{Hysteresis file formats}
{\bf Pmag GUI} will import hysteresis data from room temperature  Micromag alternating gradient magnetometers (AGM)  in several different ways.  You can import either hysteresis loops or backfield curves, or you can import whole directories of the same.  In the latter case, the file endings must be either .agm (.AGM) or .irm (.IRM) and the first part of the file must be the specimen name.
 See the documentation for  \href{#AGM\_magic.py}{AGM\_magic.py} for examples.


Now you've collected together all the files you need, we can start importing them into {\it MagIC} directory with   \href{#convert2magic}{\bf Step 1 in Pmag GUI}.



\customlink{magic_gui.py}

\chapter{MagIC GUI Tutorial}
\label{chap:MagIC GUI}

{\bf MagIC GUI} is a Graphical User Interface written by Lori Jonestrask.  It is meant for efficiently compiling a contribution for uploading to the MagIC database.  MagIC GUI is specifically designed for making a contribution without measurement data; if you ARE including measurement data, we recommend that you use \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} instead.
MagIC GUI allows you to add data at the location, site, sample, and specimen levels.  You can also add results and ages.  The program uses an Excel-like grid interface for entering and editing data.  Useful features include: pop-up menus with controlled vocabularies, multi-cell pasting from external spreadsheets, and built-in validations for MagIC database requirements.


\section{Starting with MagIC GUI}
Start up MagIC GUI.  You'll do this by clicking on the icon (if you downloaded the \href{#standalone}{standalone} version) or entering `magic\_gui.py' on your \href{#command_line}{command line} (if you downloaded the full PmagPy installation).

When you first start {\bf magic\_gui.py}, you will change directories into a  `Project Directory'. For each study, create a directory with a name that relates to that study. Here we will call it {\it MyProject}.  This is where you will collect  and process all the rock and paleomagnetic data for a given study, usually a publication.   The project directory name should have NO SPACES and be placed on the hard drive in a place that has NO spaces in the path. Under certain Windows versions, this means you should not use your home directory, but create a directory called for example: D:$\backslash$MyPmagProjects and put {\it MyProject} there.

  \includegraphics[width=25cm]{EPSfiles/MM_main_frame.eps}

\section{MagIC GUI example dataset}
Now we'll walk through a simple data input process, with fake data.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Start by clicking on `1. add location data'.  Enter location data as seen below. Notice use of the context menu: in most instances, these will provide controlled vocabularies.
    \includegraphics[width=40cm]{EPSfiles/MM_location_grid_with_menu.eps}
  \item You'll notice that some information is not filled in.  First, if you have no outside citations, you can leave `er\_citation\_names' blank and it will be automatically filled in with `This study' after you save this data.  Second, if you will be providing latitude/longitude for sites, then you don't need to provide it at the location level.  The program will extract start and end latitude and longitude from your site data and apply it to each location.
  \item If you want to provide more than the default required information, you may want to add more columns to your grid.  In our case, we'll add in `Country'.  To do this, just click the button `Add additional columns'.  Choose whatever headers you want to add and select `Ok'.

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/MM_add_location_headers.eps}

  \item Now you'll have a new column with a new controlled vocabulary.  Find and select `U.S.A.'.  When you're done entering location data, click `Save and close grid'.

  \item Next, we'll add in sites, so start by opening the site grid.  We will have two sites in this dataset, so click the `Add row(s)' button once.  Then, fill in the grid.  For some of the values, both sites will have the same value.  To provide this data more efficiently, click on the column label to edit all values in that column.  If that column has a menu, you can then click anywhere in that column and make a selection for every cell in the column. Once you're done editing the column, click the header again to exit the multiple-cell-edit mode.
  \item For controlled vocabulary columns, like `site\_type', it is possible that you might not be able to find an appropriate value, or you might not know the appropriate value.  In that case, most controlled vocabularies provide a `Not Specified' option, which we will use here.

    \includegraphics[width=40cm]{EPSfiles/MM_site_grid_with_edit_all.eps}

  \item Once you're done adding sites, save and close the site grid, then open the sample grid.
    Enter data as you see below:

    \includegraphics[width=40cm]{EPSfiles/MM_sample_grid.eps}

    All other required data will fill in automatically.  If you don't provide latitude and longitude data for a sample, it will propagate down from the site after you save and close the grid.

  \item For samples, we will add an additional statistic.  Click 'Add additional columns' and select `sample\_int\_sigma' from the 'Headers for interpretation data' column.  Select 'ok' and have a look at your new grid.  You'll notice that the column you selected has been added, as well as two additional columns: `magic\_instrument\_codes' and `magic\_method\_codes++'.  These two columns are required if you are including any interpretation data at the sample level.  Fill in the added columns.  You'll notice that `magic\_method\_codes++' has a drop-down menu.  If you aren't familiar with the MagIC codes system, click `Show method codes' which provides brief explanations for each possible code.

    \includegraphics[width=50cm]{EPSfiles/MM_sample_grid_added_cols.eps}

  \item Save and close the sample grid, then re-open it to see how the data have propagated (re-opening the grid isn't necessary for the program, this is just for you to see what MagIC GUI does automatically).

    \includegraphics[width=50cm]{EPSfiles/MM_sample_grid_propagated_full.eps}

  \item In this example, we won't add data at the specimen level, so we will be skipping step 4.  Adding specimens works just the same as adding samples.

  \item Now open the age grid.  You can assign ages at any level, at multiple levels, or at no level.  For this study, we will add ages at the sample level.  Choose sample as the age level.  Next, you'll need to add in the `age' column.  Fill in the grid as below:

    \includegraphics[width=25cm]{EPSfiles/MM_age_grid.eps}

  \item You'll notice that you can't add or remove rows in this grid.  If you want to add an additional sample, you would need to go back to the sample grid to do so.

  \item The last data step is to put in result information.  You'll need to open the result grid and, for this example, add just one statistic: `vadm'.  Then, fill out the grid:

    \includegraphics[width=45cm]{EPSfiles/MM_result_grid.eps}

  \item For each result, you will add one or more items that the result pertains to.  In this example, one result is a site V[A]DM, and the other is an averaged V[A]DM from both sites.  For now, leave magic\_method\_codes blank for the Averaged V[A]DM result: in a minute we'll see how MagIC GUI catches this error.  Save and close the result grid.

  \item Next, you will create a MagIC format upload file.  Click the final button on the main frame, `prepare upload txt file'.  Depending on the size of your contribution, this can take a minute; with our small example, it should be fairly quick.  After hitting upload, you will see an error message, and the main frame will direct you to the problem.  Validations will check for missing required fields, invalid data, and missing ancestors (for instance, a specimen with no sample).

    \includegraphics[width=25cm]{EPSfiles/MM_validation_mainframe.eps}

    Open the result grid to fix the error.  Click `Show help' for more information about validations.  In this case, it is a simple fix: add method code `LP-PI' to the average V[A]DM result.

    \includegraphics[width=45cm]{EPSfiles/MM_filled_in_result_validation.eps}

  \item Now that you've fixed your error, try `prepare upload txt file' again.  This time there should be no problems, and you are ready to \href{#magic_upload}{upload your data}!

\end{itemize}

%While \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} provides a bare bones interface for importing, interpreting and uploading most demagnetization and paleointensity experimental data into the MagIC database, {\bf MagIC.py} is a more complete (and complicated) program.
%It is an umbrella program that links many MagIC related functions of the \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy} Software Package in a user-friendly  graphical user interface (GUI).  While it is invoked with a command line call, this  can be done from any directory (with no spaces in the path).  It generates calls to the programs described in Chapter~\ref{chap:PmagPy} so you don't have to.    It allows importing of many lab and instrument formats, plotting of a variety of data and doing the data processing and book-keeping required to create files ready for uploading into the MagIC Console software.

\chapter{Survival computer skills}
\label{ex:unix}

The `Py' part of  `PmagPy' stands for Python, the language in which all the code is written.   It is not essential, but it is helpful to understand a bit about computer operating systems and the Python language when using PmagPy because no one should be using programs as black boxes without understanding what they are doing. As all the programs are open source, you have the opportunity to look into them.  If you understand a bit  about how computers work yourself, you will be able to follow along what they are doing and even modify them to work better for you.   So in this chapter you will find a brief introduction to the computer skills necessary for using the programs properly.  We have tried very hard to make this tutorial operating system independent.  All the examples should work equally well on Mac OS, Windows and Unix-type operating systems.  For a more complete explanation of the marvelous world of UNIX, refer to the website at \url{http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-quick-guide.htm}.  For handy tricks in DOS, try this link:  \url{http://www.c3scripts.com/tutorials/msdos}.
For an introduction to programming in Python, see the  Chapter on \href{#Python}{Python Programming}.   For now, we're just interested in getting started with \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy}.


\customlink{command_line}
\section{Finding your command line}
If you are not using a Unix-like computer (*NIX), you may never have encountered a command line. While the \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} is an attempt to make life as easy for you by constructing commands for you, you still need to find the command line to start it up.  Under the MacOS X operating system look for the Terminal application in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder. When it is launched, you will get a terminal window as shown below.  The Unix (and Mac OS) Bash shell has a \$ sign as a prompt.  I (LT) use the antiquated `C-shell'  (don't ask) with a \% for a prompt and  will use the \% prompt in the examples here, but any of these command line prompts will work.

  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/terminal.eps}

Under the Windows operating system, you can find your command line by searching for the ``cmd'' application. You'll use this if you are using the \href{#full_pip}{full pip installation of PmagPy}. If you are doing the \href{#full_install}{standard PmagPy install}, you will create a shortcut to the PmagPy command window on your desktop.  Double clicking on that will give you a window in which you can type {\bf PmagPy} commands.  You will use the PmagPy prompt instead of the Windows command line from there on.

  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/cmd.eps}

  Note that the location of this program varies on different computers, so you may have to hunt around a little to find yours. Also, the actual  ``prompt'' will vary for different machines.



\section{File systems}
\label{sect:file_systems}
    When you open one of these terminal windows,  you are in your  ``home'' directory.
Fundamental to all  operating systems is the concept of
directories and files.  On windows-based operating systems (MacOS or Windows), directories are depicted
as ``folders'' and moving about is accomplished by clicking on the different icons.
In the world of terminal windows, the directories have names and are arranged in a hierarchical sequence with
the top directory being the ``root'' directory, known as  ``/'' (or C:'backslash' in Windows) and the file system looks something like this:


  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/filesys.eps}

 Within the root directory, there are subdirectories
(e.g. {\bf Applications} and {\bf Users} in bold face).  In any directory, there can also be ``files''
(e.g. {\it dir\_cart\_example.dat} in italics).   To
refer to directories,  the operating system relies on what is called a ``pathname''. Every object
has an ``absolute'' pathname which is valid from anywhere on the computer.  The
absolute pathname in *NIX always begins from the root directory {\bf /} and in DOS (the operating system working in the Windows command line window), it is C:'backslash'.

The absolute pathname to the home directory {\bf lisa} in the figure is {\bf /Users/lisa}.
Similarly, the absolute pathname to the directory containing {\bf PmagPy}
scripts  would be  {\bf /Users/lisa/PmagPy}.  There is also a ``relative'' pathname,
which is in reference to the  current directory (the one you are `sitting' in).  If user ``lisa'' is sitting in
her home directory, the relative pathname for the file {\it dir\_cart\_example.dat} in the directory
{\bf data\_files} would be {\it data\_files/dir\_cart/dir\_cart\_example.dat}.  When using relative
pathnames, it is useful to remember that {\bf ./} refers to the current
directory and {\bf ../} refers to the directory  ``above''.     Also, lisa's home directory would be $\sim$lisa, or if you are logged in as lisa yourself, then it is just $\sim$.


\customlink{file_system}
\section{Moving around in the file system}

Now that you have found your command line and are comfortable in your home directory, you can view the contents of your directory with the Unix command {\bf ls} or the DOS command {\bf dir}.
\customlink{mkdir}
You can make a new directory with the command
\begin{verbatim}
%mkdir NEW_DIRECTORY_NAME
\end{verbatim}
This works in both Unix and DOS environments) and you can move into your new directory with the command
\begin{verbatim}
% cd NEW_DIRECTORY_NAME
\end{verbatim}
   To move back up into the home directory, just type {\bf cd ..} remembering that .. refers to the directory above.  Also, {\bf cd} by itself will transport you home from where ever you are (there's no place like home....).     You can also change to any arbitrary directory by specifying the full path of the destination directory.


%\section {Wildcards}
%
%Unix and DOS have the ability to refer to a number of files and/or directories using
%``wildcards''.  The  wildcard for a  single character is ``?'' and for any number of
%characters is ``*''.  For example, to refer to all the files with ``.py'' in their name in the PmagPy directory in my home directory,
%I would type:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%% ls PmagPy/*.py
%apwp.py bootams.py fishrot.py.....
%\end{verbatim}

\customlink{standard_IO}

\section {Redirecting input and output}

Programs that operate at the command line level print  output to the screen and read input
from the keyboard. This is
known as ``standard input and output'' or ``standard I/O''.
One of the nicest things about working at the command line level is the ability to redirect input and output.
For example, instead of typing input to a program with the keyboard, it can
be read from a file using the symbol {\bf $<$}.   Output can either be printed to the screen (standard output), redirected into a file using the symbol {\bf $>$}, appended to the end of a file with {\bf $>>$} or
used as input to another program with the pipe operator ({\bf$ |$}).

\section{Text editors}

There are many ways of editing text and the subject is beyond the scope of this documentation. Text editing is a blessing and a curse.  You either love it or
hate it and in the beginning, and if you are used to programs like Word, you will certainly hate it. (And if you are used to a decent text editor, you will hate Word!).      But you can't use Word because the output is in a weird format that no scripting languages read easily.  So you have to use an editor that will produce a plain (ascii) file, like Notepad, TextWrangler or Sublime Text.  \href{http://textwrangler.onfreedownload.com}{TextWrangler}  is freeware available for Macs and the notepad comes standard in the Windows operating system.   Fortunately for Mac users, Enthought Python's Canopy programming environment comes with its own text editor.

\customlink{PmagPy}

\chapter{The {\bf PmagPy} software package}
\label{chap:PmagPy}

The {\bf PmagPy} software package is a comprehensive set of programs for paleomagnetists and rock magnetists.  For installation,  follow the instructions in the \href{#quick_start}{Installing PmagPy} Chapter in this cookbook.

When you type something on your \href{#command_line}{command line}, your operating system looks for programs of the same name in special places.  These are special ``paths'' so the directory with your Python scripts has to ``be in your path''.  To inform the operating system of the new directory, you need to ``set your path''.    It should have been set when you installed {\bf PmagPy}.

\customlink{demag_gui.py}


\section{Graphical data analysis programs}
\subsection{demag\_gui.py}

The  Demag GUI (\bf demag\_gui.py}  program enables the display and analysis of paleomagnetic demagnetization data. The software will display specimen level data within the chosen directory as a Zijderveld plot, equal area plot and intensity plot. Interpretations can be made to the data as least-squares line or plane fits. Mean directions can be calculated and displayed for these interpretations. These interpretations can be exported as MagIC pmag files from the program.

\subsubsection{Launching}\label{launching}

The best way to launch the Demag GUI application is through  \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}. If PmagPy has been added to your PATH you can type pmag\_gui.py at the command line to launch it or you can navigate to the directory containing it and type \texttt{python  ./pmag\_gui.py}. Within \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}, data can be converted from the format of a particular lab into MagIC format so that it can be displayed and analyzed within Demag GUI. The program can be started by clicking on the Demag GUI button in \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.

\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_QuickMagicLauncher.eps}

{\bf Demag GUI} can also be launched through the command line by navigating to the directory containing {\bf demag\_gui.py}  and running it with:

\begin{verbatim}
% python ./demag_gui.py
\end{verbatim}

Or if {\bf PmagPy} was properly installed and has been added to your PATH, you can simply type
demag\_gui.py at the command line. \textbf{Note:} on OSX it is
recommended to launch through \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} as on wxpython 2.9 the drop-down boxes behave better when {\bf Demag GUI} is launched this way.

\subsubsection{Adding Interpretations:}\label{adding-interpretations}

A least-squares fit to the measurement data can be added by clicking the `add fit' button. Additionally, you can select the fit you would like to edit or view by using the drop-down menu under the add fit button. Once you have selected a fit, the shape of the end points of the selected fit will turn to diamond shapes to distinguish them from the other data points.\\
\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_Fit.eps}

Once the desired fit is selected, its bounds can be edited using the drop-down boxes under the bounds header.

\includegraphics[width=3 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_BoundsBox.eps}

Another way to select bounds is to double-click the list of measurement steps on the left to pick out the bounds for the interpretation. The included steps in the currently selected interpretation are shown in highlighted in blue on the measurement list and the measurements marked ``bad'' are shown in highlighted in red. In the case of duplicate measurements, the first \emph{good} measurement with the same treatment is used. All points between the selected bounds that are flagged good (i.e. not flagged bad and marked in red), including duplicate measurements, will be included in the interpreted fit..\\
\includegraphics[width=5 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_DataBox.eps}

When first created, the fit will be given a generic name such as
\emph{Fit 1}. The name of the fit can be changed from the default by typing into the drop-down box containing fit name and then pressing enter. The default fit type is a least-squares line. You can choose different fits, such as a line anchored to the origin or a plane, by using the drop-down menu under the label `interpretation type'. Plane fits can be plotted as either poles, full planes or partial planes. This display option can be changed in the second drop-down menu under specimen mean type.

\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_SpecimenMeanType.eps}

The choice between coordinate systems (i.e.~specimen, geographic or tilt-corrected) is available on the left above the list of steps. The data list and the plots will update to reflect the chosen coordinate system.

\includegraphics[width=5 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_ProjectionChoice.eps}

The properties of the currently selected fit to the data can be seen in the upper center of the GUI in a box labeled `interpretation directions and statistics'.

\includegraphics[width=15 cm]{EPSfiles/demag_gui_FitData.eps}

\subsubsection{Flagging Bad Measurement
Data}\label{flagging-bad-measurement-data}

Due to flux jumps or other such errors, individual measurements should sometimes be excluded from interpretation. Such a measurements can be flagged as ``bad'' by right-clicking them within the measurement list and the measurement will then be highlighted in red. The measurement\_flag in the magic\_measurements file will be change from ``g'' to ``b'' when a measurement is marked as ``bad'' and the step will not be included in fits that are made to the data. Any measurement marked as `bad' will be colored red in the step list and will be shown as an empty rather than filled circle on the Zijderveld, equal area and M/M\_0 plots. To change a `bad' measurement back to being `good', one can right click on it again. Upon doing so, the red highlighting will go away, the data will be shown colored in within the plots and any fit that spans that data point will be recalculated to include it.

Acceptance criteria can be set by using Analysis/``Acceptance
Criteria''/``Change Acceptance Criteria''. These criteria will be written to a {\it pmag\_criteria.txt}  table.

\subsubsection{Plot Interface}\label{plot-interface}

The four plots that take up the majority of the center of the GUI are where data and their interpretations are displayed. The Zijderveld and the two equal area plots are by default set to zoom when you left click and drag your left mouse button you will zoom to the dragged out rectangle(currently equal area plots do not draw this rectangle as you drag your mouse, but still zoom). On the Zijderveld plot, it is possible to switch between zoom and pan functionality by right clicking. Once in pan mode, the mouse will turn into a hand allowing you then to click and move around the plot. On both the Zijderveld and equal area plots if you wish to return to the original plot simply click the middle mouse button to return to home position. \textbf{Note:} in the absence of a middle mouse button pressing both right and left mouse buttons at the same time works on most laptops in the case of Macbooks clicking with two fingers should work, and if using Apple's magic mouse we recommend you download the \href{http://magicprefs.com/}{MagicPrefs} program which will allow you to configure your mouse however you prefer. One the equal area plots you can double click on an interpretation to switch the specimen and current interpretation to the clicked interpretation.

\subsubsection{Saving Specimen Interpretations}\label{saving-specimen-interpretations}

Once you have picked out your interpretations, you can save the session data in two different ways: (1) as a .redo file which will allow you to have the fits preserved to be view again with Demag GUI or (2) as MagIC {\it pmag\_*} tables to be uploaded to the MagIC database or otherwise processed. In addition, you may save image files of the plots.

\paragraph{The .redo File:}\label{the-.redo-file}

You can use Analysis/``Save current interpretations to a redo file'' to create this file type or you can just hit the save button next to add fit. \textbf{Note:} this file type does \textbf{NOT} load previous interpretations on start up you must go to the menu option Analysis/``Import previous interpretations from a redo file'' to restore your previous session.

\paragraph{The Pmag Tables:}\label{the-pmag-tables}

By going to the menu File/``Save MagIC pmag tables'' you can export your interpretations made in Demag GUI to the MagIC pmag tables which can then be used by other MagIC programs or uploaded to the MagIC database. You can export any or all of the three coordinate systems upon selecting this option and you may choose to save {\it pmag\_samples, pmag\_sites}, and {\it pmag\_results}  tables in addition to the {\it pmag\_specimens } table that is output. If you choose to output additional information you will be prompted by a pop up window for additional information. \textbf{Note:} this save format loads on start up of the GUI immediately restoring your session. Selection of this option will overwrite your {\it demag\_gui.redo} file in the working directory.

\paragraph{Images of Plots:}\label{images-of-plots}

Select the menu option File/``Save plot''/``Save all plots'' to save all plots. Or, you can save any of the plots individually. If you zoom on any of the plots the zoomed image will be saved not the originally plotted image although the plot will redraw and reset the zoom level.

\subsubsection{Deleting Specimen
Interpretations}\label{deleting-specimen-interpretations}

If you would like to delete a single interpretation, select the one you wish to delete from the interpretation drop-down menu and click delete. If you wish to clear all interpretations you may go into the interpretation editor located under the tools menu, select the fits you wish to delete and click the ``delete selected'' button.\\

\subsubsection{Higher Level Plots and
Interpretation}\label{higher-level-plots-and-interpretation}

The set of drop-down boxes to the right of the interpretation data are there to determine what level you want to analyze in the higher level analysis options include: site, sample, location, and study. The drop-down below this selects which of the available sites, samples, location, or studies to display.

You can then select how to group your data by using the drop-down menu under the show header. You can select what kind of mean to take using the first drop-down under the mean header. Which interpretations to use for the means can be selected under the second drop-down menu.

The mean statistics for the chosen higher level mean are displayed in the lower right of the GUI.

\subsubsection{Interpretation Editor}\label{interpretation-editor}

In order to more easily view and edit specimen interpretation data there is a specimen interpretation editor which can be launched from the tools menu. This panel details the fits made to the data and their parameters from which you can select which interpretation to view by double clicking on it. In the list, the currently selected interpretation is highlighted blue as shown in the image below. You can mark interpretations as bad which removes them from any Fisher means or other high level means by right clicking on their entry in the list. All interpretations marked bad are colored red in the list and marked as an `x' on the plot. The specimen entry associated with this fit will be given a bad (`b') flag within the pmag\_specimens table. Interpretations can be highlighted by clicking on the list and holding the shift or ctrl/command key to select multiple interpretations. Doing so allows you to delete or alter the characteristics of multiple interpretations at once without having to select each one in turn. This mass alteration is allowable using the the Name/Color/Bounds boxes to input the changes and then clicking the ``apply changes to highlighted fits'' button. You can delete highlighted fits using the ``delete highlighted fits'' button. The ``add fit'' button in the interpretation editor adds a fit to the current specimen. In the case of interpreting large data sets, you can reduce the number of items plotted on the equal area at the bottom of the editor and the number of entries in the log by changing the display settings.

\customlink{thellier_GUI.py}

\subsection{thellier\_gui.py}
\href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch10.html#ch10}{[Essentials Chapter 10]} and \href{#MagIC}{[MagIC}]
\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/Pmag-Cookbook/raw/gh-pages//thellier_GUI_full_manual.pdf}{[Thellier\_GUI\_full\_manual.pdf]}

The program Thellier GUI ({\bf thellier\_gui.py})  combines functions from \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py} and new tools described by  \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ggge.20062}{Shaar and Tauxe (2013)} \nocite{shaar13} in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

As with \href{#demag_gui.py}, Thellier GUI can  be called from  the  \href{#command_line}{command line} or from within \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.  It loads  files already prepared in a  \href{#ThisProject}{This Project} directory and the interpretations from Thellier GUI are part of the workflow of  \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.   This section is a brief introduction on how to use Thellier GUI as a stand alone application. Much more information is available within this manual: \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/Pmag-Cookbook/raw/gh-pages//thellier_GUI_full_manual.pdf}{Thellier GUI full manual}.

\noindent  A complete list of the definitions for paleointensity statistics used by Thellier GUI is available as a supplement to the article by \href{#http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013GC005135}{Paterson et al., 2014}  \nocite{paterson14} and available for download here:

  \url{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2013GC005135/asset/supinfo/ggge20412-sup-0001-suppinfoCORRECTED.pdf?v=1&s=e1c3ab0a86c942d1039f6d2e15496aa172dc86ec}



\customlink{choose_directory}
After launching the program,  a  ``choose project directory'' dialog window will appear as soon as the GUI is started.
%
%	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSFiles/Screenshot_choose_directory.eps}
%
%
Your  \href{#Project_Directory}{ThisProject} directory should include a file named {\it magic\_measurements.txt} (created for example by \href{#pmag_gui.py}{\bf Pmag GUI}.   If a file named {\it rmag\_anisotropy.txt} is in the project directory, then the program reads in the anisotropy data. Reading and processing the measurements files may take several seconds, depending on the number of the specimens.


\subsubsection{Reading and compiling measurements data}
When your \href{#Project_Directory}{ThisProject}  project directory is selected, the program  reads all the measurement data, checks them, processes them and sorts them. If non-linear-TRM (NLT) data exist in {\it magic\_measurement.txt}  then the program tries to process the data using Equations (1)-(3) in \href{#http://dx.doi.org/MAGIC/doi/10.1016/j.epsl.2009.12.022}{Shaar et al., 2010}. \nocite{shaar10}  The program reads {\it magic\_measurement.txt}, and processes the measurements for presentation as Arai  and Zijderveld plots.
We recommend that you check all the warnings and errors in {\it Thellier\_GUI.log} before starting to interpret the data.  For details about warnings and error messages during these steps, consult the tutorial document in the {\it thellier\_GUI} folder in  {\it data\_files}.  Also, consult the Preferences to change certain plotting options.

\subsubsection{Main panel}

This figure shows a snapshot of the main panel.

  \includegraphics[width=30cm]{EPSFiles/Screenshot_main_panel.eps}

\noindent
  The top field in the  panel includes the following buttons/controls (from left to right):
  \begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Specimen:} a list of the specimens in the project folder sorted by name.
\item {\bf previous/next:} buttons to move forward and backward in the specimens list.
\item {\bf T min/T max:} buttons to select temperature bounds.
\item {\bf save/delete:} save or delete current interpretation. This information will be used later to generate a \href{#mk_redo.py}{redo file}.
\item {\bf B\_lab:} laboratory field in units of $\mu T$.
\item {\bf B\_anc:} specimen's paleointensity in units of $\mu T$.
\item {\bf Aniso Correction:} anisotropy correction factor.
\item {\bf NLT Correction:} Non-Linear TRM (NLT) correction factor.
\item {\bf Dec/Inc:} Specimen declination/inclination calculated by PCA of the NRM in the selected temperature bounds.
\item Sample mean, number of specimens, standard deviation and percent standard deviation.
\end{itemize}

The center of the main panel has these elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf measurements text panel:} Four columns of the measurement data: Step is ``N`` for NRM, ``Z`` for zero field step, ``I`` for infield step, ``P`` for pTRM check, and ``T`` for tail check. The temperature of each step is given in C. Also shown  declination, inclination and moment (in units of $Am^2$)
\item {\bf Arai plot:}  Arai plot normalized by $NRM_0$. blue circles are zero field steps, red circles are infield steps, triangles are pTRM checks, blue squares are tail checks. Temperatures are displayed near data points. Temperature bounds and best fit line are marked in green. 'SCAT box' is marked with dashed lines (only if SCAT is True).
\item {\bf Zijderveld plot:}  A Zijderveld plot of the NRM step.  The x axis is rotated to the direction of the NRM, blue is the x-y  projection, and red is x-z projection.
\item {\bf Equal area plot:}  An equal area projections  of the NRM steps. solid circles are positive inclination. open circles are negative inclinations.
\item {\bf Moment-temperature plot:}  NRMs are in blue, pTRMs are in red.
\item {\bf sample data:}  If at least two specimens have a saved interpretation, then their values are displayed on this plot. The mean $\pm$ standard deviation of the mean are marked as  horizontal lines.
\end{itemize}

The bottom of the main panel include paleointensity statistics. The first line has  the threshold values (empty if N/A). The second line is the specimen's statistics. For details see Appendix A1 in \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ggge.20062}{Shaar and Tauxe (2013)}. \nocite{shaar13}

%\item{Manual interpretation}
%Manual interpretation is the conventional approach of selecting temperature bounds for each specimen. Here, as example, we will interpret one sample, su100601,  manually.
%%\customlink{acceptance_criteria}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Set acceptance criteria: From the menu-bar choose  Analysis $\rightarrow$ Acceptance criteria $\rightarrow$ Change acceptance criteria. A criteria dialog box will appear.
%\item In the first line (specimen's statistics) set the following values: n=3, int\_ptrm\_n=2, SCAT=false (unchecked), gap\_max=0.5, f\_vds=0.75, beta=0.1, MAD=6, DRATS=20. delete the values in the other boxes (empty boxes).
%\item In the second line (Sample's acceptance criteria) set the following values: int\_n=3. delete the value in the other boxes.
%\item In the third line (Sample mean calculation method: STDEV-OPT) check the Enable/Disable box, and set the following values: int\_sigma=6, int\_sigma\_perc=10. Delete values in the other boxes. Figure 3 shows how it should look. Click on the OK button. A message dialog will appear telling you the criteria that you chose are saved in a file name pmag\_criteria.txt. The next time you will open the GUI in this project directory, these criteria will automatically be chosen. Click OK on the message box.
%\item Manual interpretation of sample su100601: choose specimens su100601a from the specimen list. choose temperature bounds from the Tmin/Tmax windows: 200 and 580. B\_anc shows 61.7 in green, which means that this interpretation passes the specimen's acceptance criteria. Now, change Tmax to 530.  B\_anc window change color to red, and also the fvds window (the row on the bottom of the GUI). This is an indication that the interpretation did not meet the criterion for fvds. Change  Tmax to 580 (as before) and press ``save`` button. The interpretation in saved.
%\item Click on the next button to choose the next specimen (su100601b). Before analyzing this specimen, press on the ``previous`` button, so you can see that your previous interpretation was saved. click on ``next`` to return again to specimen su100601b. Find  temperature bounds that pass the criteria (for example 200,580). Make sure that all colors are green, and click on the ``save`` button. Go over all the other specimens in the sample (su10060a to su100601g). you will find that three specimens can pass: a,c, and g. Look at the Sample data figure (top right) it shows the saved interpretation for all the specimens in the sample, and the mean $\pm$  standard deviation of the mean.
%\item To save all your interpretation into files, choose from the menubar Analysis $\rightarrow$ Save current interpretation. Three files will be generated in the project directory:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item thellier\_GUI.redo (the temperature bounds for each specimen):
%\begin{verbatim}
%su100601a 473 853

%\item You can save the Arai plot (or any other plots) from the File menu. Choose  file  $\rightarrow$ Save Plot $\rightarrow$ Save Arai plot. A file dialog window will appear. You can change the format of the figure in the bottom tab (pdf, svg, or png), but you can also save as other format by adding the appropriate suffix to the file name.
%\item close the GUI: File  $\rightarrow$ Quit.
%\item Re-open the GUI as before (by writing the command  ``thellier\_gui.py''  in the terminal window) and choose the same working directory (SU1\_example). Notice now that the criteria that you set before are automatically used. To import your previous interpretations and continue working on this dataset choose from the menu bar Analysis $\rightarrow$ import previous interpretation. Choose thellier\_GUI.redo and click on the 'open' button.

%\item Choose from the menu bar Auto interpreter $\rightarrow$ Run Thellier auto interpreter. The interpreter will run approximately 30 seconds. When its done, a message window will appear saying that the interpreter finished successfully (if not, check for errors in the terminal window, or in a file name {\it thellier\_interpreter.log}  located in a folder named {\it thellier\_interpreter}. If the issue cannot be resolved send an e-mail with the description of the problem to rshaar@ucsd.edu). Click OK in the message window.
%\item The automatic interpretations are automatically saved, and we can review them on the Arai plots.  Let's look, for example, at the sample we interpreted  manually: su100601. Choose specimen su100601a from the specimens list. At first glance, the choice seems strange because the automatic interpretation chose temperature bounds 0 and 580. A choice between 200 and 580 may seem more reasonable as it provides an nearly straight line. The sample data figure explains this issue. The {\bf thellier\_auto\_interpreter.py} program chooses the interpretations that minimize the standard deviation of the sample's mean. Six specimens from this sample passed the criteria, and the value of su100601a is much higher than the remaining five. So, the thellier\_auto\_interpreter chose the 'acceptable' interpretation with the shallowest  slope. Go over the other specimens in the sample, and review the automatic interpretations. If you want, you can change the automatic interpretation, and save your own ``manual'' interpretation by choosing Analysis $\rightarrow$ Save current interpretation. Note that the output of {\bf thellier\_auto\_interpreter.py} is sensitive to the choice of the acceptance criteria, and different criteria may lead to significantly different final results.

%\href{http://magician.ucsd.edu/~ltauxe/CV/open/shaar12.pdf}{Shaar and Tauxe (2012)} \nocite{shaar12} discuss a method to choose the optimal specimen's acceptance criteria. Here, we follow the example given in this paper. \href{http://magician.ucsd.edu/~ltauxe/CV/open/shaar12.pdf}{Shaar and Tauxe (2012)} suggested using  seven statistics for specimen's acceptance criteria. The choice of four of which is trivial, and the remaining three are MAD, FRAC and $\beta$. The thellier\_optimizer\_2D helps finding the optimal values for FRAC and $\beta$.  The thellier\_optimizer\_2D  required three types of inputs: 'fixed\_criteria``, ``test\_groups``, and ``test\_samples``, as described below:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The test groups are defined in an ``er\_sample`` file. An example for this file is given in working folder SU-1 named  ``optimizer\_test\_groups.txt``.

%\item To run the optimizer choose from the menu bar Optimizer $\rightarrow$ Run Thellier optimizer. click OK in the  message dialog. The first step is setting the 'fixed\_criteria``. We choose for the specimen's criteria: n=3, int\_ptrm\_n=2,SCAT=checked, gap\_max=0.6, MAD=5.0. We choose for the sample's criteria:int\_n=3, int\_n\_outlier\_check=6, EnableSTDEV-OPT, int\_sigme\_uT=5, int\_sigma\_perc=6. The rest of the boxes should be empty. click OK. click OK on the message window that will appear.

\subsection{MagIC GUI}

This application provides a simple interface for transforming data from a paleomagnetic or rock magnetic study into the format necessary for contribution to the MagIC database.

\section{Command line PmagPy programs}

{\bf PmagPy}  scripts work by calling them on a \href{#command_line}{command line}.
 The python scripts must be placed in a directory that is in your ``path''.  To see if this has been properly done, type {\bf dir\_cart.py -h} on the command line and you should get a help message.  If you get a ``command not found'' message, you need to fix your path; check the ``installing python'' page on the software website.   Another possible cause for failure is that somehow, the python scripts are no longer executable.  To fix this, change directories into the directory with the scripts, and type the command:  chmod a+x *.py

For people who hate command line programs and prefer graphical user interfaces with menus, etc., some of the key programs for interpreting paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data are packaged together in a program called {\href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.  This can be invoked by typing {\bf pmag\_gui.py} on the command line.
The \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} program generates the desired commands for you behind the scenes, so you do not have to learn UNIX or how to use the command line (except to call {\bf Pmag GUI} itself).  Nonetheless, some understanding of what is actually happening is helpful, because {\bf Pmag GUI} is more limited than  full range of {\bf PmagPy} programs.  So, here is a brief introduction to how the {\bf PmagPy} programs work.

All {\bf PmagPy} programs print a help message out if you type: {\bf program\_name.py -h} on the command line.  Many have an ``interactive'' option triggered by typing {\bf program\_name.py -i}.  Many also allow reading from \href{#standard_IO }{standard input and output}.   The help message will explain how each particular program functions.  There are some common features for the command line options:


\begin{itemize}
\item Switches are from one to three characters long, preceded by a '-'.
\item The switch '-h' always prints the help message and '-i' allows interactive entry of options.
\item  Options for command line switches immediately follow the switch.  For example:  -f INPUT -F OUTPUT will set the input file to INPUT and the output to OUTPUT.
\item  The switch for input  files all start with -f and -F for output files.
\item -spc -sam -sit -syn  -loc are switches relating to specimens, samples, sites, synthetics and locations respectively.
\item Capitalized switches suppress an option (e.g., -A means do not average, while -a means DO average).
\item -crd [s,g,t] sets the coordinate system
\item -fmt [svg,png,jpg] the default image format.
\item -sav  saves the plots silently and quits the program
\end{itemize}
\newcommand{\stt}{\small\tt}
\newcount\exnum
\outer\def\example{\medbreak\advance\exnum by 1
  \noindent{$\item$ \bf Example \the\exnum\enspace} \noindent}

 The {\bf PmagPy} scripts call on two special modules, the {\bf pmag} and the {\bf pmagplotlib} modules.  These contain most of the calculations and plotting functions.

 The source code and the help messages for all programs in the PmagPy package are also available online at:

 \customlink{github}

 \url{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy}

A link to these source code/help menu files is provided for each program listed below with the format [program\_name\_docs].

Examples of how to use command line {\bf PmagPy} programs are given below. In all examples, the '\$' prompt stands for whatever command line prompt you have. The example data files referred to in the following are located in the {\it data\_files} directory bundled with the {\bf PmagPy} software distribution.

Anisotropy of anhysteretic or other remanence can be converted to a tensor and used to correct natural remanence data for the effects of anisotropy remanence acquisition.  For example, directions may be deflected from the geomagnetic field direction or intensities may be biased by strong anisotropies in the magnetic fabric of the specimen.  By imparting an anhysteretic or thermal remanence in many specific orientations, the anisotropy of remanence acquisition can be characterized and used for correction.   We do this for anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence (AARM) by imparting an ARM in 9, 12  or 15 positions.  Each ARM must be preceded by an AF demagnetization step.    The 15 positions are shown in the \href{#k15_magic.py}{k15\_magic.py} example.




 For the 9 position scheme,  {\bf aarm\_magic.py} assumes that the AARMs are imparted in positions 1,2,3, 6,7,8, 11,12,13.    Someone (a.k.a. Josh Feinberg) has kindly made the measurements and saved them an \href{#sio_magic.py}{SIO formatted measurement file} named {\it arm\_magic\_example.dat} in the datafile directory called {\it aarm\_magic}.   Note the special format of these files - the treatment column (column \#2) has the position number (1,2,3,6, etc.) followed by either a ``00'' for the obligatory zero field baseline step or a ``10'' for the in-field step.  These could also be `0` and `1'.

 We need to first import these into the magic\_measurements format and then calculate the anisotropy tensors.  These can then be plotted or used to correct paleointensity or directional data for anisotropy of remanence.

So,  first use the program \href{#sio_magic.py}{\bf sio\_magic.py}  to import the AARM data  into the MagIC format.  The DC field was 50 $\mu$T, the peak AC field was 180 mT, the location was `Bushveld' and the lab protocol was AF and Anisotropy.   The naming convention used Option \# 3 (see help menu).

Then use the program \href{#aarm_magic.py}{aarm\_magic.py}  to calculate the best-fit tensor and write out the MagIC tables: {\it rmag\_anisotropy} and {\it rmag\_results}.   These files can be used to correct remanence data in a {\it pmag\_specimens} format table (e.g, intensity data) for the effects of remanent anisotropy (e.g., using the program \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic\_redo.py}.

Here is a transcript of a session that works.   Note that the {\bf  sio\_magic.py}  command is all on one line (which is what the terminal backslash means).

\begin{verbatim}

Anisotropy data can be plotted versus depth.  The program {\bf ANI\_depthplot.py} uses MagIC formatted data tables of the {\it rmag\_anisotropy.txt} and {\it er\_samples.txt} types.  {\it rmag\_anisotropy.txt} stores the tensor elements and measurement meta-data while {\it er\_samples.txt} stores the depths, location and other information.  Bulk susceptibility measurements can also be plotted if they are available in a {\it magic\_measurements.txt} formatted file.

In this example, we will use the data from Tauxe et al. (2012) \nocite{tauxe12} measured on samples obtained during Expedition 318 of the International Ocean Drilling Program.  To get the entire dataset, go to the MagIC data base at:  \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/}
and find the data using the search interface.   As a short-cut, you can use the ``permalink'':

Unpack the data using the program \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py}.  This will unpack the data into the different holes.  Change directories into Location\_2 (which contains the data for Hole U1359A).  Or, you can use the data in the {\bf ANI\_depthplot} directory of the example data files.

Make a plot of the data using {\bf aniso\_magic.py}.  Use the site parametric bootstrap option and plot out the bootstrapped eigenvectors.   Draw on the trace of the dike.

The specimen eigenvectors are plotted in the left-hand diagram with the usual convention that squares are the $V_1$ directions, triangles are the $V_2$ directions and circles are the $V_3$ directions.  All directions are plotted on the lower hemisphere.     The bootstrapped eigenvectors are shownin the middle diagram.   Cumulative distributions of the bootstrapped eigenvalues are shown to the right with the 95\% confidence bounds plotted as vertical lines.
It appears that the magma was moving in the northern and slightly up direction along the dike.

There are more options to {\bf aniso\_magic.py} that come in handy.   In particular, one often wishes to test if a particular fabric is isotropic (the three eigenvalues cannot be distinguished), or if a particular eigenvector is parallel to some direction. For example, undisturbed sedimentary fabrics are oblate (the maximum and intermediate directions cannot be distinguished from one another, but are distinct from the minimum) and the eigenvector associated with the minimum eigenvalue is vertical. These criteria can be tested using the distributions of bootstrapped eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The following session illustrates how this is done, using the data in the test file {\it sed\_anisotropy.txt} in the aniso\_magic directory.

$ aniso_magic.py -f sed_anisotropy.txt -d 3 0 90 -v -crd g

 which makes these plots:

   The top three plots are as in the dike example before, showing a clear triaxial fabric (all three eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors are distinct from one another.  In the lower three plots we have the distributions of the three components of the chosen axis,  $V_3$, their 95\% confidence bounds (dash lines) and the components of the designated direction (solid line).

Anisotropy of thermal  remanence (ATRM) is similar to anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence (AARM) and the procedure for obtaining the tensor is also similar.  Therefore, the program {\bf atrm\_magic.py} is quite similar to \href{#aarm_magic.py}{aarm\_magic.py}.  However, the SIO lab procedures for the two experiments are somewhat different.  In the ATRM experiment, there is a single, zero field step at the chosen temperature which is used as a baseline.  We use only six positions (as opposed to nine for AARM) because of the additional risk of alteration at each temperature step.  The positions are also different:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/atrm_meas.eps}

The file {\it atrm\_magic\_example.dat} in the {\it atrm\_magic} directory is an SIO formatred data file containing ATRM measurement data done in a temperature of 520$^{\circ}$C.   Note the special format of these files - the treatment column (column \#2) has the temperature in centigrade followed by either a ``00'' for the obligatory zero field baseline step or a ``10'' for the first postion, and so on.  These could also be `0` and `1', etc..

Use the program \href{#sio_magic.py}{sio\_magic.py} to import the ATRM data  into the MagIC format.  The DC field was 40 $\mu$T.  The naming convention used option \# 1 (see help menu).
Then use the program {\bf atrm\_magic.py} to calculate the best-fit tensor and write out the MagIC tables: {\it rmag\_anisotropy} and {\it rmag\_results} formatted files.   These files can be used to correct remanence data in a {\it pmag\_specimens} format table (e.g, intensity data) for the effects of remanent anisotropy (e.g., using the program \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic\_redo.py}.

Many paleomagnetists save orientation information in files in this format:
Sample  Azimuth Plunge  Strike  Dip (AZDIP format),  where the Azimuth and Plunge are the declination and inclination of the drill direction and the strike and dip are the attitude of the sampled unit (with dip to the right of strike).   The MagIC database convention is to
use the direction of the $X$ coordinate of the specimen measurement system.  To convert an  {\it AzDip} formatted file ({\it example.az}) for samples taken from a location name ``Northern Iceland''  into the MagIC format and save the information in the MagIC {\it er\_samples.txt}  file format, use the program {\bf azdip\_magic.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
$  azdip_magic.py -f azdip_magic_example.dat -ncn 1 -mcd FS-FD:SO-POM
      -loc ``Northern Iceland``

Data saved in  er_samples.txt
\end{verbatim}

Note that there are many options for relating sample names to site names and we used the first convention that has a single character at the end of the site name to designate each sample (e.g., is132d is sample 'd' from site is132).   We have also specified certain field sampling and orientation method codes (-mcd), here field sampling-field drilled (FS-FD) and sample orientation-Pomeroy (SO-POM).  The location was ``Northern Iceland''.   See the help menu for more options.

Another way to do this is to use the \href{#orientation_magic.py}{orientation\_magic.py} program which allows much more information to be imported.

It is often useful to plot measurements from one experiement against another.  For example, rock magnetic studies of sediments often plot the IRM against the ARM or magnetic susceptibility.  All of these types of measurements can be imported into a single {\it magic\_measurements} formatted file, using magic method codes and other clues (lab fields, etc.) to differentiate one from another.
Data  were obtained from a Paleogene core from 28$^{\circ}$S for a relative paleointensity study.    IRM, ARM, magnetic susceptibility and remanence data were uploaded to the MagIC database.  The magic\_measurements formatted file for this study is saved in {\it core\_measurements.txt}.

Use the program {\bf biplot\_magic.py} to make a biplot of  magnetic susceptibility against ARM.  Note that the program makes use of the \href{#method_codes}{MagIC method codes} which are LT-IRM for IRM, LT-AF-I for ARM (AF demagnetization, in a field), and LP-X for magnetic susceptibility.

First, to find out which data are available, run the program like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$  biplot_magic.py -f biplot_magic_example.txt
   which responds with this:
   ['LT-AF-Z', 'LT-AF-I', 'LT-IRM', 'LP-X']
   \end{verbatim}

These are the method codes for  AF demagnetization of NRM, ARM, IRM and susceptibility measurements respectively.  So to make a plot of
susceptibility against ARM, we would run the program again:


\begin{verbatim}
$  biplot_magic.py -f biplot_magic_example.txt -x LP-X -y LT-AF-I
LP-X  selected for X axis
LT-AF-I  selected for Y axis
All
measurement_magn_mass  being used for plotting Y
measurement_chi_mass  being used for plotting X.

S[a]ve plots, [q]uit,  Return for next plot

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/bootams.py}{[bootams docs]}

The program {\bf bootams.py} calculates bootstrap statistics for anisotropy tensor data in the form of:

x11 x22 x33 x12 x23 x13

It does this by selecting para-data sets and calculating the Hext average eigenparameters.
It has an optional parametric bootstrap whereby the $\sigma$ for the data set as a whole is used to draw new para data sets.    The bootstrapped eigenparameters are assumed to be Kent distributed and the program calculates Kent error ellipses for each set of eigenvectors.  It also estimates  the standard deviations of the bootstrapped eigenvalues.

Use this to calculate the bootstrapped error statistics for the data in file {\it  bootams\_examples.data}:

\begin{verbatim}
$  bootams.py -par -f bootams_example.dat
Doing bootstrap - be patient

tau tau_sigma V_dec V_inc V_eta V_eta_dec V_eta_inc V_zeta V_zeta_dec V_zeta_inc

\end{verbatim}

Paleointensity experiments are quite complex and it is easy to make a mistake in the laboratory.  The SIO lab uses a simple chart that helps the experimenter keep track of in-field and zero field steps and makes sure that the field gets verified before each run.   You can make a chart for an infield-zerofield, zerofield-infield (IZZI) experiment using the program {\bf chartmaker.py}.   Make such a chart using 50$^{\circ}$C steps up to 500$^{\circ}$C  followed by 10$^{\circ}$C steps up to 600$^{\circ}$C.

\begin{verbatim}

The chart allows you to fill in the file name in which the data were stored and the field value intended for the
infield steps.  The designations `Z', `I', 'T', 'and 'P'  are for zero-field, in-field, pTRM tail checks and pTRM checks respectively.  There are fields for the date of the runs, the fields measured in different zones in the oven prior to the start of the experiment, and the start and stop times.  The numbers, e.g., 100.1 are the treatment temperatures (100) followed by the code for each experiment type.  These get entered in the treatment fields in the SIO formatted magnetometer files (see \href{#SIO_magic}{sio\_magic.py}).

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/common_mean.py}{[common\_mean docs]}

Most paleomagnetists use some form of Fisher Statistics to decide if two directions are statistically distinct or not (see \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch11.html#ch11}{Essentials Chapter 11} for a discussion of those techniques.  But often directional data are not fisher distributed and the parametric approach will give misleading answers.  In these cases, one can use a boostrap approach, described in detail in \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch12.html#ch12}{[Essentials Chapter 12]}.  Here we
use the program {\bf common\_mean.py} for a bootstrap test for common mean to check whether two declination, inclination data sets have a common mean at the 95\% level of confidence.    The data sets are: {\it common\_mean\_ex\_file1.dat } and {\it common\_mean\_ex\_file2.dat}.  But first, let's look at the data in equal area projection  using the program \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}.

The session:
\begin{verbatim}
$ eqarea.py -f common_mean_ex_file1.dat -sav
1  saved in  common_mean_ex_file1.dat.svg

$  eqarea.py -f common_mean_ex_file2.dat -sav
1  saved in  common_mean_ex_file2.dat.svg
\end{verbatim}

\noindent generates two .svg formatted files that look like these:


  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/common-mean-eq.eps}

Now let's look at the common mean problem using {\bf common\_mean.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ common_mean.py -f common_mean_ex_file1.dat -f2 common_mean_ex_file2.dat
Doing first set of directions, please be patient..
Doing second set of directions, please be patient..
S[a]ve plots, <Return> to quit

\noindent The three plots are:

%\epsfxsize 14.5cm
{ %\epsffile{EPSfiles/common-mean.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/common-mean.eps}}

These suggest that  the two data sets share a common mean.

Now compare the data in  {\it common\_mean\_ex\_file1.dat }  with the expected direction at the 5$^{\circ}$N latitude that these data were collected (Dec=0, Inc=9.9).

To do this,  follow this transcript:

\begin{verbatim}
$ common_mean.py -f common_mean_ex_file1.dat -dir 0 9.9
Doing first set of directions, please be patient..
S[a]ve plots, <Return> to quit
\end{verbatim}

%\epsfxsize 14.5cm
{% \epsffile{EPSfiles/common-mean-EX.eps}

Then make the plot for Africa adjusted  to the paleomagnetic reference frame.  Make the continental outlines in black lines and set the resolution to 'low'.

The program will plot whole core data, discrete sample at a bulk demagnetization step, data from vector demagnetization experiments, and so on.  There are many options, so check the help menu before you begin.

We can try this out on some data from DSDP Hole 522, measured by Tauxe and Hartl (1997).  \nocite{tauxe97}  These can be downloaded and unpacked (see \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py} for details),  or you can try it out on the data files in the directory {\bf core\_depthplot}.   You must specify a lab-protocol (LP) for plotting.  In this example, we will plot the alternating field (AF) data after the 15 mT step.  The magnetizations will be plotted on a log scale and, as this is a record of the Oligocene, we will plot the Oligocene time scale, using the calibration of Gradstein et al.

NB:  The best place to customize your selection criteria is within \href{#demag_gui.py}{Demag GUI} or \href{#thellier_gui.py}{Thellier GUI}.  But if you want to do it on the command line, then here's how.

The MagIC database allows documentation of which criteria were used in selecting data on a specimen, sample or site level and to easily apply those criteria (and re-apply them as they change) in preparing the different tables.  These choices are stored in the {\it pmag\_criteria} table in each MagIC project directory (see \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI} documentation).

 Certain {\bf PmagPy} programs use the datafile {\it pmag\_criteria.txt} to select data (for example {\bf thellier\_magic.py} and {\bf specimens\_results\_magic.py}).  To customize these criteria for your own data sets, you can use the program {\bf customize\_criteria.py}.  This program is also called by the {\bf Pmag GUI} under the Utilities menu.    Try it out on {\it pmag\_criteria.txt}.   This is a ``full vector'' set of criteria - meaning that it has both directions and intensity flags set.  Change the {\it specimen\_alpha95} cutoff to 180. from whatever it is now set to.   Save the output to a new file named {\it new\_criteria.txt}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ customize_criteria.py -f pmag_criteria.txt -F new_criteria.txt

Paleomagnetic data are frequently plotted in equal area projection.  PmagPy has several plotting programs which do this (e.g., \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}, but occasionally it is handy to be able to convert the directions to X,Y coordinates directly, without plotting them at all.  The program {\bf di\_eq.py} does this.  Here is an example transcript of a session using the datafile {\it di\_eq\_example.dat}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ di_eq.py -f di_eq_example.dat
-0.239410 -0.893491
0.436413 0.712161
0.063844 0.760300

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/di_geo.py}{[di\_geo docs]}

Use the programs {\bf di\_geo.py}  to convert
$D=8.1, I=45.2$ from specimen coordinates  to geographic  adjusted coordinates. The
orientation of laboratory arrow on the specimen was: azimuth = 347;
plunge = 27.
{\bf di\_geo.py} works in the usual three ways (interactive data entry, command line file specification or from  \href{#standard_IO}{standard input }.  So for a quickie answer for a single specimen, you can use the interactive mode:

\begin{verbatim}
$ di_geo.py -i
Declination: <cntrl-D> to quit  81
Inclination: 45.2
Azimuth: 347
Plunge: 27
   94.8    43.0
\end{verbatim}
\noindent which spits out our answer of Declination = 5.3 and inclination = 71.6.

For more data, it is handy to use the file entry options. There are a bunch of declination, inclination, azimuth and plunge data in the file {\it di\_geo\_example.dat} in the {\it di\_geo} directory.  First look at the data in specimen coordinates in equal area projection, using the program \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}.  Note that this program only pays attention to the first two columns so it will ignore the orientation information.

\begin{verbatim}
$ eqarea.py -f di_geo_example.dat
\end{verbatim}
which should look like this:

  \includegraphics[width=12 cm]{EPSfiles/di_geo_spc_eq.eps}



The data are highly scattered and we hope that the geographic coordinate system looks better!  To find out try:
\begin{verbatim}
di_geo.py -f di_geo_example.dat >di_geo.out;  eqarea.py -f di_geo.out

\end{verbatim}

\noindent which looks like this:

  \includegraphics[width=12 cm]{EPSfiles/di_geo_geo_eq.eps}

  \noindent These data are clearly much better grouped.

\subsection{di\_rot.py}
\href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch11.html#ch11}{[Essentials Chapter  11]}
\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/di_rot.py}{[di\_rot docs]}


Generate a Fisher distributed set of data from a population with a mean direction of $D=0, I=42$ using the program {\bf fishrot.py}.  Calculate the mean direction of the data set using {\bf gofish.py}.  Now use the program \href{#di_rot.py}{di\_rot.py} to rotate the set of directions to the mean direction.  Look at the data before and after rotation using \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ fishrot.py -I 42 >fishrot.out
$ gofish.py <fishrot.out
    1.7    42.4    100    95.3720     21.4     3.1
$ di_rot.py -f fishrot.out -F dirot.out -D 1.7 -I 42.4
$ eqarea.py -f fishrot.out
 $ eqarea.py -f dirot.out
\end{verbatim}

\noindent  which generates plots like these:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/dirot.eps}

Note that every instance of {\bf fisher.py} will draw a different sample from a Fisher distribution and your exact plot and average values will be different in detail every time you try this (and that's part of the fun of statistical simulation.)

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/di_tilt.py}{[di\_tilt docs]}


Use the program {\bf di\_tilt.py} to rotate a direction of Declination = 5.3 and Inclination = 71.6 to ``stratigraphic'' coordinates.  The  strike was 135 and the dip was 21.
The convention  in this program is to use  the dip direction, which  is to the ``right'' of
this strike.


Here is  a session with {\bf di\_tilt.py} using the interactive option:

\begin{verbatim}
$ di_tilt.py -i
Declination: <cntl-D> to quit 5.3
Inclination: 71.6
Dip direction: 225
Dip: 21
  285.7    76.6

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/dir_cart.py}{[dir\_cart docs]}

Use the program {\bf dir\_cart.py} to convert the
following data from declination $D$, inclination $I$ and intensity
$M$ to $x_1,x_2,x_3$.


\begin{tabular}{lll}

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/eq_di.py}{[eq\_di docs]}

Data are frequently  published as equal area projections and not listed in data tables.  These data can be digitized as x,y data (assuming the outer rim is unity) and converted to approximate directions with the program {\bf eq\_di.py}.  To use this program, install a graph digitizer (GraphClick from \url{http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/} works on Macs).

Digitize the data from the equal area projection saved in the file {\it eqarea.png} in the {\it eq\_di} directory.
You should only work on one hemisphere at a time (upper or lower) and save each hemisphere in its own file.  Then you can convert the X,Y data to approximate dec and inc data - the quality of the data depends on your care in digitizing and the quality of the figure that you are digitizing.

Try out {\bf eq\_di.py} on your datafile, or use {\it eq\_di\_example.dat} which are the digitized data from the lower hemisphere and check your work with {\bf eqarea.py}.  You should retrieve the lower hemisphere points from the {\bf eqarea.py} example.

\begin{verbatim}
$ eq_di.py -f eq_di_example.dat >tmp
$ eqarea.py -f tmp
\end{verbatim}

NB: To indicate that your data are UPPER hemisphere (negative inclinations), use the -up switch.


You can verify the process by comparing the plot generated for these data using \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py} with the original png file.

A data file was prepared using \href{#tk03}{tk03.py} to simulate directions at a latitude of 42$^{\circ}$.   Use the program \href{#dipole_pinc.py}{dipole\_pinc.py} to find what the expected inclination at this latitude is!

The data were ``flattened'' with the program \href{#squish.py}{squish.py} which uses the formula $ \tan I_o = f \tan I_f$ to simulate inclination error and saved in a data file {\it find\_EI\_example.dat} in the {\it find\_EI} directory.

Use the program {\bf find\_EI.py} to find the optimum flattening factor $f$ which, when used to ``unflatten'' the data  yields inclination   and  elongation (ratio of major and minor eigenvalues of orientation matrix, see the section on  \href{Webbook2.html#orientation_tensor}{eigenvalues} in the textbook)  most consistent with the TK03.GAD paleosecular variation model of Tauxe and Kent (2004). \nocite{tauxe04d}

\end{verbatim}

Now read from the file {\it igrf\_example.dat} which requests field information for near San Diego for the past 3000 years.  The program will evaluate the field vector for that location for dates from 1900 to the present using the IGRF/DGRF coefficients in the IGRF-11 model available from:
\url{http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html}.   For the period from 1000 BCE to 1800, the program uses the CALS3k.4b of Korte and Constable (2011) \nocite{korte11a} available at: \url{http://earthref.org/ERDA/1142/}.    Prior to that and back to 8000 BCE, the program uses the coefficients of Korte et al., 2011 \nocite{korte11b} for the CALS10k.1b, available at:
\url{http://earthref.org/ERDA/1403/}

\begin{verbatim}
$ igrf.py -f igrf_example.dat -F igrf.out
\end{verbatim}

You can also make a plot of secular variation of field elements by specifying the age range and location on the command line.  Try this for the location of San Diego for the age range: -3000 1925 in increments of 50 years:

\begin{verbatim}
$ igrf.py -ages -3000 1950 50 -loc 33 -117 -mod pfm9k -plt

Use the program {\bf incfish.py} to calculate average inclination for inclination only data
simulated by fishrot.py for an average inclination of 60$^{\circ}$.   If you save the declination, inclination
pairs, you can compare the {\bf incfish.py} answer with the Fisher mean.    The datafile {\it incfish\_example\_di.dat} has the declination, inclination pairs and {\it incfish\_example\_inc.dat} has just the inclinations.

\begin{verbatim}
$ fishrot.py -I 60 -k 10 > incfish_example_di.dat

\end{verbatim}

The output for {\bf incfish.py} is:  [gaussian] mean inc, Fisher inc, $N, R, k, \alpha_{95}$.  You can see that the {\bf incfish.py} result is much closer to the Fisherian result than the gaussian mean is.

%\subsubsection{Importing  data into the MagIC Project Directory}
%\label{sect:upload}
%
%Data do not magically appear in the database.  The paleomagnetic community must contribute them.  One way to accomplish this is to use PmagPy to import measurement data into the MagIC format.  You can use the MagIC.py GUI for this purpose.  Find some example datafiles in the subdirectory `PmagPy\_tutorial' of the \href{#Datafiles}{Datafiles\_2.0 directory}.
%Within this subdirectory, you will find a directory called `{\it MyFiles}'.  This contains data from alternating field demagnetization ({\it mc\_af.mag}), thellier-type experiments ({\it mc\_thel.mag}),  anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence ({\it mc.aarm}), hysteresis loops ({\it mc205a1-1.agm} and {\it mc217a2-1.agm}) as well as a file containing  field orientation, location, etc. ({\it orient.txt}), age information ({\it er\_ages.txt}) and citation information ({\it er\_citations.txt}).
%
%Follow the steps outlined in \href{#quick_start}{Quick Start}  to create a Project Directory  and launch the {\bf MagIC.py} GUI.  Create a directory called {\it MagIC} in your Project Directory.  Different operating systems will have a different look, but all versions will put up a Welcome window when you have fired up the program MagIC.py.
%
%Now import the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item  Field and sampling information: \href{#field\_info}{orient.txt}.
%   \begin{itemize}
%		\item   Select orientation file:  choose your orient.txt file from MyFiles.
%		\item Select naming convention:   In this tutorial choose the first naming convention  XXXXY (e.g., sample mc200a is related to site mc200 by a terminal character).
%		\item Select orientation convention...:  Choose to use the IGRF calculation at the site and enter 13 hours for the hours to add to get from McMurdo time to GMT.  These samples were oriented with a Pomeroy orientation device so the correct orientation method is \#1, the default.
%		\item  Select method codes: Check 'FS-FD' and 'SO-POM'.   All the site locations were determined with a GPS.
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item {Importing magnetometer data:}
%  For the example here, we will use the \href{#sio_magic.py}{SIO} format and  import the following files: {\it mc\_af.mag, mc\_thel.mag, mc\_aarm.mag} which are the AF demagnetization data, Thellier experiments, and anisotropy of  anhysteretic magnetization respectively.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Select \href{#naming_schemes}{naming convention}:  Choose the first option (XXXXY).
%		\item Next you will be presented with forms a form to file out with details like the location name (here, McMurdo) and laboratory protocol particulars. It is strongly encouraged to fill in the location name as this will save much head ache later on.   In the example files provided here,   specimen names are all related to the sample	names by a terminal single character (specimen mc200a2 came from sample mc200a), so the number of characters to distinguish a specimen from a sample is '1'.  This is the default value so you don't actually have to enter the '1' in the forms for this example.
%		\item Check the appropriate  protocols for each file.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item For the AF file ({\it mc\_af.mag}), check the AF box:
%			\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/make_sio_tut_af.eps}
%			\item For the Thellier experimental data ({\it mc\_thel.mag}), check the 'T' box and fill in the DC field value (30 $mu$T):
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/make_sio_tut_af.eps}
%			\item  For the AARM data, check the 'ANI' box and the 'AF' box and fill in the peak AF (180 mT) and dc field values (50 $\mu$T) to the right:
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/make_sio_tut_aarm.eps}
%		\end{itemize}
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item{Importing hysteresis data}
%There are two different modes for importing hysteresis/backfield data:  by file or by directory.  As there are only two in this example, we will use the former:
%
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/hysteresis.eps}
%
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Select the file.
%		\item Select the  \href{#naming_schemes}{naming convention}.  Choose the first option as before.
%		\item Enter the location name (McMurdo),  and the specimen name (same as file name) and number of characters to delineate the specimen from the sample (3, in this example).
%		\item Indicate  that these files are in cgs units).
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item To combine all the data together, select \href{#Combining_measurement_files}{Combining measurement files}.
%	\item Import Prior Interpretations:
%	There are several ways to import prior interpretations  in MagIC.py.  One of the ways is to use the output of  the\href{#zeq_magic.py}{zeq\_magic.py} and \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py} programs which interpret   directional (AF and thermal)  and paleointensity (Thellier-type)  experimental  data respectively.  They produce {\it pmag\_specimen} formatted files called {\it zeq\_specimens.txt} and  {\it thellier\_specimens.txt}  respectively.   The original interpretations from the Lawrence et al. (2009) paper are in the MyFiles directory.  These can be imported by choosing the 'Import prior interpretations' menu and choosing the MagIC formatted specimen file option.
%	\item{Importing MagIC formatted files:}
%There are two other MagIC formatted files already filled out for this study: {\it er\_citations.txt} and {\it er\_ages.txt}.  The first has the relevant citation information,  and the second age determinations for particular sites Import these files into the MagIC directory using the `Import MagIC formatted file' option.
%\end{itemize}
%
%After you have imported your various datafiles, you can process them using the tools in the \href{#AnalysisPlotsMenu}{Analysis and Plots menu}.    All of these options generate and execute command line calls for various \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy} programs.  The GUI uses default options because it ``knows'' the names of the files it has created, saving you from having to figure that out.   Many of these options require you to type things in on the command line, such as 'a' to s[a]ve plots, 'q' to quit, or simply return to increment the specimen name.  Follow the instructions for the specific program that are printed  in the terminal window   (see also the documentation in the section on \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy} programs). Once the program has exited, control will be returned to the MagIC.py GUI.
%
%The plots that are available to you now are:  Demagnetization data, Thellier-type experimental data, and Hysteresis data.
%You may change the selection criteria from the defaults if you wish.
%
%When you are finished looking at and perhaps re-interpreting the data, you are ready to prepare the data for the MagIC  database.  This is a three step process under the \href{#PrepareMagic}{Prepare for MagIC } menu:
%:  Assemble specimens, Assemble results and Prepare upload file.  \begin{itemize}
%		\item \href{#PrepareMagic}{Assemble specimens}:  Just choose this and watch the console for errors.
%		\item	\href{#PrepareMagic}{Assemble results}:  Fill in the following:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Choose the default selection criteria (unless you changed them, in which case you can select the customized option  -exc).
%			\item Age Range: These samples ranged from zero to five million years, so fill in '0', '5' and choose 'Ma' under the
%			\item   Choose the present latitude (-lat option) for calculating VADMs.
%          \item Coordinate system:  Choose the geographic coordinate system.
%          \item If you want to look at the data on a site by site basis, select the -p option.
%		\end{itemize}
%		\item Prepare upload txt file:  The \href{#Uploading}{MagIC } will import a specially formatted ascii file, parsing all the tables into their correct tabs and allowing you to proceed to the final steps of file preparation for uploading into the database.   It will create an {\it er\_locations.txt} file for you based on what is in the {\it er\_sites.txt} file.  It will ask you for the missing required information.   In this case, the location type was 'Outcrop'.  Then the GUI prepares a file called {\it upload\_dos.txt} which can be directly imported into the MagIC console.
%\end{itemize}
%
%  After you have assembled the results some additional equal area projections  and utilities will be available to you, if you wish to try these out.
%
%  \subsubsection{Using the MagIC Console}
%
%  To obtain the MagIC Console software, go to:
%
%   \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC}
%
%   \noindent and select `MagIC Software v2.4'.  Click on the `CONSOLE SOFTWARE' and  'CONTROLLED VOCABULARIES' links.  Unzip the Console software and put the Controlled vocabularies file into it (copying over whatever was there).  As of this writing the Console works on both Macs and PCs, but is extremely slow on the Mac OS operating system.  Having been warned,  open Excel and then select the 'MagIC.v24.console' file.  This will open the console.  Under 'Operations', select 'new smartbook' and type the name 'Tutorial' in the File name text box.
%
%  The 'wizard' will guide you in choosing the necessary columns for the smartbook:
%
%  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSFiles/wizard.eps}
%
%\noindent  Click on the 'Use predefined settings...' choose   `Classical Directional and Intensity Study' and click 'OK'.  Then add 'Measurement data' and   `Rock Magnetics' and click on the 'Next$>>$' button.  Check the boxes for 'Anisotropy' and 'Hysteresis' data and click on the  'Finish' button.  Your smartbook is now ready for populating.
%
%  Under the 'Operations' menu, select `Import data files' and choose the 'upload\_dos.txt' file in your MagIC project directory.
% This reads it in and parses it out to the right tables.  Any error logs generated will be in the directory with the upload\_dos file.  When you have satisfied your curiosity about the contents of the smartbook, click on the 'Prepare for uploading' option under the 'Operations' menu.  After you indicate that you really want to do this, the console goes through some extensive checking.   If errors are encountered, you will be given the opportunity to correct them.  When the console  is finished,  it exports an Excel file (in this case Tutorial.v24.xls) and a text file (in this case Tutorial.v24.txt).  If this were a real study, you would upload these into the MagIC database by going to:
%\url{  http://earthref.org/MAGIC }
%  and selecting 'Upload a new contribution'.
%  Do NOT upload this file to the database, as all uploaded datasets must be associated with publications.  This was just a Tutorial.

\subsection{magic\_select.py}
\href{#MagICDatabase}{[MagIC Database]}
\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/magic_select.py}{[magic\_select docs]}


This program takes any \href{#MagIC}{MagIC} formatted file and selects lines that match the search criteria and saves the output as a new MagIC formatted file of the same type.  Selection criteria match whole or partial strings, avoid whole or partial strings or evaluate minimum or maximum values.    The syntax is to specify the input file with the -f option, the key you wish to search on with -key, followed by the string you wish to use as a criterion, followed with a 'T' for match exactly, 'F' avoid entirely, 'has' for matching partially and 'not for avoiding any partial match, and min, max and eval for evaluating the numerical value.  The -F option sets the output file.

  For example, you could pick out all the records that match a certain site name string.  You could select out records with specified method codes.  You could get all records with inclinations that are positive.

  Use {\bf magic\_select.py} to pick out all the best-fit lines based on AF demagnetization data from the {\it pmag\_specimens.txt} file unpacked from the MagIC database in the \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py} example.

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/AGM_magic.py}{[AGM\_magic docs]}


This program imports Micromag  hysteresis files into magic\_measurements formatted files.
Because this program imports data into the MagIC database, specimens need also to have sample/site/location information which can be provided on the command line. If this information is not available, for example if this is a synthetic specimen,  specify -syn  SYN\_NAME for synthetic on the command line instead of the -spn SPEC\_NAME switch.

Someone named Lima Tango has measured a  synthetic specimen named {\it myspec}  for hysteresis and saved the data in a file named {\it agm\_magic\_example.agm}.   The backfield IRM curve for the same specimen was saved in {\it agm\_magic\_example.irm}.  Use the program {\bf AGM\_magic.py} to import the data into a magic\_measurements formatted output file.  These were measured using cgs units, so be sure to set the units switch properly.   Combine the two output files together using \href{#combine_magic.py}{combine\_magic.py}.    [This can be plotted using {\bf hysteresis\_magic.py} or {\bf quick\_hyst.py}.]    {\bf hysteresis\_magic.py} will calculate various hysteresis parameters and put them in the relevant magic tables for you.  ]

 Craig Jones' {\bf PaleoMag} software package (\url{http://cires.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag3.html}) imports various file formats, including the so-called 'CIT' format developed for the  Cal Tech lab.The documentation for the CIT sample format is here: \url{http://cires.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_Formats.html#SAM_format}.
 Demagnetization data for each specimen is in its own file in a directory with all the data for a study.
These files are rather strictly formatted with fields determined by the character number in the line.   A typical datafile (hat tip Swanson-Hysell et al. (2009)) \nocite{swansonhysell09} has this format:

\begin{verbatim}

There is an optional first line with 'CIT' on it (not shown here).

There must be a file with the suffix `.sam' in the same directory which gives details about the samples and a list of the data files in the directory.    The .sam file has the form:

\begin{verbatim}
Mamainse Point

MP18-1
MP18-2
MP18-3
MP18-4
MP18-5

\end{verbatim}

The first line is a comment, the second is the latitude and longitude followed by a declination correction.

For detailed description of the file format, check \href{http://cires.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag3.html}{the PaleoMag} home page.

Use the program {\bf CIT\_magic.py} to import the data files from the example data files in the {\it CIT\_magic} directory of the {\it Measurement\_Import} directory of the {\it data\_files} directory.   The location name was ``Mamainse Point'', the \href{#naming_schemes}{naming convention} was \#2 and they were collected by drilling and with a magnetic compass.

\begin{verbatim}

This program was developed for the late Prof.  Hagai Ron at the Hebrew Universisty, Jerusalem for files with formats like this:


\begin{verbatim}

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/LDEO_magic.py}{[LDEO\_magic docs]}


This program works in much the same fashion as \href{#sio_magic.py}{sio\_magic.py} but the file formats are different.  Here is a typical example:

\begin{verbatim}
isaf2.fix

\end{verbatim}
The first line is the file name and the second has the latitude and longitude information. The columns are:
\begin{verbatim}
        ID: specimen name
        TREAT:  treatment step
        I:  Instrument
        CD:  Circular standard devation
        J: intensity.  assumed to be total moment in 10^-4 (emu)
        CDECL:  Declination in specimen coordinate system
        CINCL:  Declination in specimen coordinate system
        GDECL:  Declination in geographic coordinate system
        GINCL:  Declination in geographic coordinate system
        BDECL:  Declination in bedding adjusted coordinate system
        BINCL:  Declination in bedding adjusted coordinate system
        SUSC:  magnetic susceptibility (in micro SI)a
        M/V: mass or volume for nomalizing (0 won't normalize)
\end{verbatim}

Use the program to import the file {\it ldeo\_magic\_example.dat} into the MagIC format.  It was an AF demagnetization experiment.

\begin{verbatim}
$ LDEO_magic.py -f ldeo_magic_example.dat -LP AF
results put in  magic_measurements.txt
\end{verbatim}

\customlink{IODP_csv_magic.py}
\subsubsection{IODP\_csv\_magic.py}

Just for fun, download the whole core data from IODP expedition 318, Site U1359, Hole A. (Section Half set to 'A') from the \href{#LIMS}{IODP LIMS database} using WebTabular.    These data were used in \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012PA002308}{Tauxe et al. (2012)} \nocite{tauxe12} after some editing (removal core ends and disturbed intervals).   Convert them into the MagIC format using {\bf ODP\_csv\_magic.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ IODP_csv_magic.py -f SRM_318_U1359_A_A.csv
processing:  SRM_318_U1359_A_A.csv
specimens stored in  ./er_specimens.txt
samples stored in  ./er_samples.txt
......
Averaged replicate measurements
data stored in  ./magic_measurements.txt
\end{verbatim}

This takes a while so be patient....

You can also downloaded the {core summary} data from the \href{#LIMS} {LIMS} database and convert it to the MagIC format using \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.
Now you can plot the data and the core tops using \href{#core_depthplot.py}{core\_depthplot.py}

This format is the one used to import  .PMD formatted magnetometer files (used for example in the PaleoMac software of Cogn\'e, 2003) \nocite{cogne03} into the MagIC format.  (See \url{http://www.ipgp.fr/~cogne/pub/paleomac/PMhome.html} for the PaleoMac home page.
The version of these files that {\bf PMD\_magic.py} expects (UCSC version) contains demagnetization data for a single specimen and have a format like this:

The first line is a comment line.  The second line has the specimen name, the core azimuth (a=) and plunge (b=) which are assumed to be the lab arrow azimuth and plunge (\href{#orientation_schemes}{Orientation scheme} \#4)D.   The third line is a header explaining the columns in the file.


Use {\bf PMD\_magic.py} to convert the file {\it ss0101a.pmd} in the directory 'PMD' in the 'PMD\_magic' folder of the {\it Measurement\_import} directory in the example {\it data\_files } directory.  These were taken at a location named 'Summit Springs' and have a naming convention of the type XXXX[YYY], where  YYY is sample designation with Z characters from site XXX, or \customlink{naming_schemes}naming convention \# 4-2.  A single character distinguishes the specimen from the sample (-spc 1).  All samples were oriented with a magnetic compass.

\begin{verbatim}
$ PMD_magic.py -f ss0101a.pmd -loc ``Summit Springs`` -ncn 4-2 -spc 1 -mcd SO-MAG -F ss0101a.magic
 results put in  ./magic_measurements.txt
sample orientations put in  ./er_samples.txt
\end{verbatim}

Because each file must be imported separately, you should use a different name for the output file for each input file (otherwise you will overwrite the default each time) and set the switch  for sample file to append for subsequent imports:

\begin{verbatim}
$ PMD_magic.py -f ss0102a.pmd -loc ``Summit Springs`` -ncn 4-2 -spc 1 -mcd SO-MAG -F ss0102a.magic-Fsa er_samples.txt
sample information will be appended to  ./er_samples.txt
results put in  ./magic_measurements.txt
sample orientations put in  ./er_samples.txt
\end{verbatim}
After you finish importing all the data, combine the individual files together with \href{#combine_magic.py}{combine\_magic.py} and look at them with, for example, \href{#zeq_magic.py}{zeq\_magic.py}.

%(see also \href{#PMM_redo.py}{PMM\_redo.py}  for importing interpretations made on these files using the UCSC (Jarboe)   software).

The treatment field is the temperature (in centigrade), the AF field (in mT), the impulse field  strength, etc.  For special experiments like IRM acquisition, the  coil number of the popular ASC impulse magnetizer can be specified if the treatment steps are in volts.  The \href{#k15_magic.py}{position} for anisotropy experiments or whether the treatment is ``in-field'' or in zero field also require special formatting.  The units of the intensity field are in cgs and the directions are relative to the `lab arrow' on the specimen.  Here are some examples of commonly used specimens and conversions from field arrow to lab arrow.

As an example, we use data from Sbarbori et al. (2009) \nocite{sbarbori09} done on a set of samples  from the location ``Socorro'', including AF, thermal,  and thellier experimental data.  These were saved in {\it sio\_af\_example.dat, sio\_thermal\_example.dat, and sio\_thellier\_example.dat} respectively.  The lab field for the thellier experiment was 25 $\mu$T and was applied along the specimen's Z axis (phi=0,theta=90).]
   Convert the example files  into magic\_measurement formatted files with names like
    {\it af\_measurements.txt}, etc.    Then combine them together with \href{#combine_magic}{combine\_magic.py}:

The first two lines are headers.  The first column of the second line is the applied field in $\mu$T. The rest of this line is azimuth and plunge of the fiducial line and dip direction and dip of the bedding plane.
The data columns are:
specimen, treatment, intensity,  declination and inclination.
the intensity is the magnetization in 10$^{-3}$ A/m.   The treatment is of the form XXX.YY  where XXX is the temperature and YY is   00, 11, 12, 13, 14  OR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4   where 0 is the NRM step, 11/1 is the pTRM acquisition step, 12/2 is the pTRM check step and 13/3 is the pTRM tail check.  14/4 is the additivity check.

Use the program {\bf TDT\_magic.py} to import the ThellierTool tdt formatted file  {\it TDT\_magic\_example.dat} into the MagIC format.   The field was 52.12 $\mu$T applied along the 0,0 direction.

These programs use {\it magic\_measurements} formatted files and perform calculations as dictated by a ``redo'' file which has the specimen name, bounds for calculation and, in the case of the demagnetization data interpretation, the type of calculation desired (best-fit lines with \href{http://earthref.org/cgi-bin/magic-s1-methods.cgi?database_name=magic\qquad &search_start=methods\qquad &category=Direction%20Estimation}{directional estimation magic method code}:{DE-BFL}, best-fit planes with those with  magic method code DE-BFP, etc.).

 Make ``redo'' files from the existing  {\it pmag\_specimen} formatted file in the data files downloaded from the MagIC website as in {\bf download\_magic.py} and examine them as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mk_redo.py
$ cat zeq_redo

\href{#MagIC}{MagIC}
\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/nrm_specimens_magic.py}{[nrm\_specimens\_magic docs]}

After making NRM measurements, it is frequently useful to look at the directions in equal area projection to get a ``quick look'' at the results before proceeding to step wise demagnetization.  The data in the magic\_measurements files are usually in specimen coordinates - not geographic, so we need a way to rotate the data into geographic and or stratigraphic coordinates and save them in a pmag\_specimens formatted file for plotting with {\bf eqarea\_magic.py}.   The program {\bf nrm\_specimens\_magic.py} will do this for you.

Get into the directory you made for the {\bf download\_magic.py} example.   \newline Use {\bf nrm\_specimens\_magic.py} to convert the NRM measurements in  {\it magic\_measurements.txt }   to geographic coordinates saved in a file named {\it nrm\_specimens.txt}.  The orientation data are in the file {\it er\_samples.txt}.    Then plot the specimen directions for the entire study using {\bf eqarea\_magic.py}:


 \begin{verbatim}
$ nrm_specimens_magic.py -crd g
er_samples.txt  read in with  271  records
Data saved in  nrm_specimens.txt

$ eqarea_magic.py -f nrm_specimens.txt

sr01e2 SO-SUN   333.7    67.0
...

 \end{verbatim}

 The first command created a file {\it nrm\_specimens.txt} and the second created an equal area projection of the NRM directions in geographic coordinates which should look like this:

  Try to import the file {\it orientation\_example.txt} into the {\it er\_samples.txt} and {\it er\_sites.txt} files using {\bf orientation\_magic.py}.  Click \href{#field_info}{here}  for details about the {\it orient.txt} file format.  It has field information for a few sites.  The samples were oriented with a Pomeroy orientation device  (the default) and it is desirable to calculate the magnetic declination from the IGRF at the time of sampling (also the default).  Sample names follow the rule that the sample is designated by a letter at the end of the site name (convention \#1 - which is the default).  So we do this by:

\customlink{parse_measurements.py}

\subsection{parse\_measurements.py}

This program reads in the {\it magic\_measurements.txt} file and creates an {\it er\_specimens.txt} file.   The specimen volumes and/or weights can then be put in columns labeled {\bf specimen\_volume} and {\bf specimen\_weight} respectively.  Volumes must be in m$^3$ and weights in kg.  (Yes you can do the math...).

Try this out on the {\it magic\_measurements.txt} file created in the \href{#irmaq_magic.py}{irmaq\_magic.py} example.  Pretend you have a bunch of specimen weights you want to use to normalize the NRM with the program \href{#measurements_normalize.py}{measurements\_normalize.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ parse_measurements.py

site record in er_sites table not found for:  318-U1359A-002H-4-W-65
.....
\end{verbatim}

The program appears a bit flustered because you have no {\it er\_sites.txt} file in this directory.  If you DID, you would overwrite whatever site name was in that file onto the specimen table.  This allows you to carry the changes in that table through to the specimen table (see \href{#orientation_magic.py}{orientation\_magic.py}.)

This program tests whether two sets of observations (one with normal and one with reverse polarity) could have been drawn from distributions that are 180$\,^{\circ}$ apart using the McFadden and McElhinny (1990) implementation of the Watson (1983) V statistic test for a common mean. The implementation of the V statistic test in this program is the same as in \href{#Watsons_v.py}{watsons\_v.py}. Use \textbf{revtest\_MM1990.py} to perform a reversal test on data from the Ao et al., 2013 study of Early Pleistocene fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Nihewan Basin of North China.

Lets plot the combined data set \textit{Ao\textunderscore etal2013\textunderscore combined.txt} using \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ eqarea.py -f Ao_etal2013_combined.txt

be patient, your computer is doing 5000 simulations...

Results of Watson V test:

Watson's V:           2.7
Critical value of V:  6.0
``Pass``: Since V is less than Vcrit, the null hypothesis that the
 two populations are drawn from distributions that share a
 common mean direction (antipodal to one another) cannot be rejected.

M&M1990 classification:

Angle between data set means: 2.9
Critical angle for M&M1990:   4.3
The McFadden and McElhinny (1990) classification for this test is: `A'
\end{verbatim}

As with \href{#Watsons_v.py}{watsons\_v.py}, this program produces a plot that displays the cumulative distribution (CDF) of the Watson V values resulting from the Monte Carlo simulation. In the plot below, the red line is the CDF, the green solid line is the value of the V statistic calculated for the two populations and the dashed blue line is the critical value for the V statistic. In this example, the data are consistent with the two directional groups sharing a common mean as evidenced by V (green solid line) being a lower value than the critical value of V (dashed blue line).

There are frequently outlier directions when looking at data at the site level.  Some paleomagnetists throw out the entire site, while some arbitrarily discard individual samples, assuming that the orientations were `bad'.  Lawrence et al. (2009) \nocite{lawrence09} suggested a different approach in which common causes of misorientation are specifically tested.  For example, if the arrow indicating drill direction (see \href{#orientiation\_magic.py}{orientation conventions}) was drawn the wrong way on the sample in the field, the direction would be off in a predictable way.  Similarly (and more commonly) extraneous marks on the sample were used instead of the correct brass mark, the directions will fall along a small circle which passes through the correct direction.  The program {\bf site\_edit\_magic.py} plots data by site on an equal area projection, allows the user to select a particular specimen direction and plots the various pathological behaviors expected from common misorientations.  If the stray directions can reasonably be assigned to a particular cause, then that sample orientation can be marked as `bad' with a note as to the reason for exclusion and the directions from that sample can be excluded from the site mean, and the reason can be documented in the MagIC database.

Try this out using the data downloaded  in the \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py} example.

Starting from the magnetometer output files, paleomagnetists interpret the data in terms of vectors, using software like \href{#zeq_magic.py}{zeq\_magic.py} or \href{thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py}.  The interpretations from these programs are stored in pmag\_specimen formatted files.
Once a pmag\_specimens format file has been created, the data are usually  averaged by sample and/or by site and converted into \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch2.html#Virtual_dipole_moment}{V[A]DMs} and/or
\href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch2.html#Virtual_geomagnetic_poles}{VGPs} and put in a pmag\_results formatted file along with the location and age information that are available.  Data must be selected or rejected according to some criteria at each level (for example, the specimen MAD direction must be less than some value or the site $\kappa$ must be greater than some value).   This onerous task can be accomplished using the program {\bf specimens\_results\_magic.py}.          This program has many optional features, so the reader is encouraged just to look at the documentation.

Test it out  by using the data files created in the \href{#site_edit_magic.py}{site\_edit\_magic.py} example.  Block the interpretation of some of the samples owing to `bad' orientation.  Change the selection criteria using \href{customize_criteria.py}{customize\_criteria.py}.    Then generate a new {\it pmag\_specimen.txt} file using \href{#mk_redo.py}{mk\_redo.py},  \href{#zeq_magic_redo.py}{zeq\_magic\_redo.py} and \href{#combine_magic.py}{combine\_magic.py}.   Then do the averaging by site with {\bf specimens\_results\_magic.py}.  The age bounds of the data are 0-5 Ma (-age 0 5 Ma).  Use the existing (or modified) criteria (-exc option).   There are some paleointensity data, so use the current site latitude for the VADM  calculation (-lat option).   Calculate the data in the geographic coordinate system (-crd g).    Then extract the data into tab delimited tables using \href{#pmag_results_extract.py}{pmag\_results\_extract.py}

Save the following in a file called {\it sundec\_example.dat}:

\begin{verbatim}
3 35 33 1994 5 23 16 9 68
\end{verbatim}
which is:

$\Delta_{GMT}$ lat lon year mon day hh mm shadow\_angle

We can analyze this file with either:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sundec.py -f sundec_example.dat
  154.2
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
$ sundec.py < sundec_example.dat
  154.2
\end{verbatim}
or by manual input:
\begin{verbatim}
$ sundec.py -i

NB:  This program is no longer maintained.  You should try \href{#thellier_GUI.py}{thellier\_gui.py} instead.

To see how {\bf thellier\_magic.py}  works, download the text file from a recent paper by Shaar et al. (2011) from the MagIC database:

\nocite{shaar11}
\url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/doi/0.1016/j.epsl.2010.11.013}

Unpack the data with \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py}.   The original interpretations are stored in a file called {\it pmag\_specimens.txt}, but {\bf thellier\_magic.py} looks for a specimen file called {\it thellier\_specimens.txt}.  To create such a file, use the program \href{#mk_redo.py}{mk\_redo.py} followed by \href{#thellier_magic_redo.py}{thellier\_magic\_redo.py}.  Then you can take a look  at the data using \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py} and change some of the interpretations, for example adding one for the specimen s2s0-01 which was rejected by Shaar et al. (2011).   This has both non-linear TRM acquisition and ATRM anisotropy data, so the corrections will have to be applied using {\bf thellier\_magic\_redo.py} after exiting the \href{thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py} program.

Here is a transcript of a session that does all this:

This program is no longer maintained. This function is embedded in  \href{#thellier_GUI.py}{thellier\_gui.py} when you import a specimen file.



This program allows the recalculation of paleointensity experimental data derived from Thellier type experiments.  It allows correction for remanence  anisotropy from AARM or ATRM ellipsoids (stored in {\it rmag\_anisotropy} format files (see \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch13.html#ch13}{[Essentials Chapter 13]} and the \href{#aarm_magic.py}{aarm\_magic.py} and \href{#atrm_magic.py}{atrm\_magic.py}) and \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch10.html#non-linear_TRM}{non-linear TRM} corrections, if TRM aquisition data are available (see also \href{#trmaq_magic.py}{trmaq\_magic.py}).


Apply the corrections to the  data you re-interpreted in the \href{#thellier_magic.py}{thellier\_magic.py} example,   and create a new {\it pmag\_specimens.txt} formatted file, use the program {\bf thellier\_magic\_redo.py}.   First, create a ``redo'' file using \href{#mk_redo.py}, then re-do the calculations using {\bf thellier\_magic\_redo.py}, including anisotropy and non-linear TRM corrections.    Combine all the specimen files into one using \href{#combine_magic.py}{combine\_magic.py}.

Sometimes it is useful to generate a distribution of synthetic geomagnetic field vectors that you might expect to find from paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field.  The program {\bf tk03.py} generates distributions of field vectors from the PSV model of Tauxe and Kent (2004).  \nocite{tauxe04}    Use this program to generate a set of vectors  for a latitude of 30$^{\circ}$ and plot them with \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ tk03.py -lat 30 >tk03.out
$ eqarea.py -f tk03.out
\end{verbatim}

which should give you a plot something like this:

\includegraphics[width=12cm]{EPSfiles/tk03.eps}


\customlink{uniform.py}
\subsection{uniform.py}
\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/uniform.py}{[uniform docs]}

It is at times handy to be able to generate a uniformly distributed set of directions (or geographic locations).  This is done using a technique described by Fisher et al. (1987).

Draw 50 directions from a uniform distribution and save to a file called {\it uniform.out}.  Then plot the directions with \href{#eqarea.py}{eqarea.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
$  uniform.py -F uniform.out -n 50
$ eqarea.py -f uniform.out
\end{verbatim}

which should yield a plot something (but not exactly) like this:

This program is no longer maintained. This function is embedded in  \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.



In the SIO laboratory, our default specimen naming scheme has a logical relationship to the sample and site names.
Sometimes there is no simple relationship and the MagIC import procedure can't parse the sample name into a site name, or the original concept of a site gets changed, for example if several lava flows turn out to be the same one.  In any case, there must be a way to change the way data get averaged after the measurement data get converted to a magic\_measurments formatted file.  To do this, the sample, site relationship can be established in the {\it er\_sample.txt} file for example via the procedure described in \href{#orientation_magic.py}{orientation\_magic.py} docuementation.  After the correct relationships are in the {\it er\_samples.txt} file, these must be propagated throughout the rest of the MagIC tables, starting with the {\it magic\_measurements.txt} file.  The program {\bf update\_measurements.py} will do this at the measurements level.  \href{#specimens_results_magic.py}{specimens\_results\_magic.py} will then propagate the changes through to the {\it pmag\_results.txt} file.

\href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/blob/master/programs/upload_magic.py}{[upload\_magic docs]}


 This function is embedded in  \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.



This program takes all the MagIC formatted files and puts them into a file which can be imported into the MagIC console software for uploading into the \href{http://earthref.org/MagIC}{MagIC database}.
As an example, we can ``repackage'' the file used file downloaded in the \href{#download_magic.py}{download\_magic.py} example.  You could re-interpret that data or fix records with errors, then re-upload the corrected file.

In the {\it upload\_magic} directory in the example {\it data\_files} directory, someone has entered all the site latitudes as longitudes and vice versa (surprisingly common!).    You can fix this in the {\it er\_sites.txt} file, by swapping the headers sample\_lat/sample\_lon in the {\it er\_samples.txt} file and site\_lat/site\_lon in the {\it er\_sites.txt} file then run \href{#specimens\_results\_magic.py}{specimens\_results\_magic.py} to propogate the changes through to the results table.  Be sure to set the criteria switch (-exc), the latitude switch (-lat), the geographic coordinate switch (-crd g) and the age switch (-age 0 5 Ma).    Then re-package the files for uploading.

AFTER fixing the {\it er\_samples.txt} and {\it er\_sites.txt} files, do the following:



\begin{verbatim}
$ specimens_results_magic.py -exc -lat -age 0 5 Ma -crd g

 Put the data into a file {\it vgp\_di\_example.dat} for example using {\bf cat} on a *NIX operating system.
Here is a transcript of one way to use the program which spits out declination, inclination:

\begin{verbatim}

First generate two data files with {\bf fishrot.py} with $\kappa$ = 15, $N=10$ and $I$ = 42, with $D$ = 10. for the first and 20 for the second:

$ fishrot.py -k 15 -n 10 -I 42 -D 20 > watsons_f_example_file2.dat
\end{verbatim}

To compare these two files using {\bf watsons\_f.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ watsons_f.py -f watsons_f_example_file1.dat -f2 watsons_f_example_file2.dat
7.74186876032 3.2594 3.2594
\end{verbatim}

The first number is Watson's  $F$ statistic for these two files (see \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch11.html#ch11}{Essentials Chapter 11}) and the second is the number to beat for the two files to be drawn from the same fisher distribution (share a common mean).   In this case  the data fail this test ($F$ is greater than the required number).    Your results may vary!

\noindent  which generates the plot:


\includegraphics[width=12cm]{EPSfiles/watsonsV_example.eps}

 The two files are significantly different because Watson's V (10.5 in this example) is greater than the $V_{crit}$ value estimated using Monte Carlo simulation (6.8).

 Note that your results may vary in detail because every instance of {\bf fishrot.py}  generates  a different randomly drawn dataset.

Use the program {\bf zeq.py} to 1) plot a Zijderveld diagram of the data in \newline {\it zeq\_example.txt}.  b) Calculate a best-fit line from 15 to 90 mT.  c) Rotate the data such that the best-fit line is projected onto the horizontal axis (instead of the default, North).   d) Calcualte a best-fit plane from 5 to 80 mT.  Save these plots.


\begin{verbatim}
$ zeq.py -f zeq_example.dat -u mT
\end{verbatim}

 By selecting `b', you can pick the bounds and choose 'l' for best-fit line or  `p' for best-fit plane.  You can rotate the X-Y axes  by selecting `h' and setting the X axis to 312.   Finally, you can save your plots with the 'a' option.   You should have saved something like these plots:

%\epsfxsize 14.5cm

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/zeq.eps}}

The equal area projection has the X direction (usually North in geographic coordinates)
          to the top.  The red line is the X axis of the Zijderveld diagram.  Solid symbols are lower hemisphere.
          The solid (open) symbols in the Zijderveld diagram are X,Y (X,Z) pairs.  The demagnetization diagram plots the
          fractional remanence remaining after each step. The green line is the fraction of the total remanence removed
          between each step.

\chapter{The MagIC database and file formats}

A number of the programs in {\bf PmagPy} were  developed to take advantage of the MagIC database and aid getting data in and out of it.   So, we need some basic understanding of what MagIC is and how it is structured.
MagIC  is an Oracle  database that is part of the EarthRef.org collection of databases and digital reference material.
Anyone interested in the MagIC database should first become a registered EarthRef.org user.  To do this, go to \url{http://earthref.org} and click on the {\bf Register} link in the {\bf Topmenu}.   Registration is not required for access to data or browsing around, but is required for uploading of data into the MagIC database, something which we sincerely hope you will have a chance to do.
%By registering, you will also be kept informed of our progress through bi-monthly newsletters and other email alerts.
After you register, go to \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/search}.


You can \href{#magic_download}{download data} using the \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/search}{MagIC search} website.
%Data from a particular reference can be found by typing the digital by typing in the author's name in the ``Reference Text Search'' box, or search by any column with a little magnifying glass icon.   If you click on the   You can show or hide columns  and look at data at various levels (location, site, sample, and so on to retrieve the data you want.
%  Once the data you want have been identified, you can download the data by clicking on the `Save Results' button.

       After downloading, the data can be unpacked and examined using various tools in the {\bf PmagPy}  package, for example using \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.

\customlink{Uploading}

%\section{Uploading data to the database}

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data are collected and analyzed in a wide variety of ways with different objectives.  Data sets can be extremely large or can be the barest boned data summaries published in legacy data tables.   The goal of MagIC has been to have the flexibility to allow a whole range of data including legacy data from publications or other databases to new studies which include all the measurements, field photos, methodology, and so on.  The general procedure for the future will be to archive the data at the same time that they are published.    So, to smooth the path, it is advisable to put your data into the MagIC format as early in the process as possible.  All data that enters the database must be converted to the standard MagIC format either as a set of MagIC tables, or as one combined text file.    These can then be uploaded into the MagIC database.
%Here,  we illustrate the use of  a number of programs (the \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy}  package in Python) to facilitate the `behind the scenes' process of making MagIC formatted tables.

\customlink{DataTables}

\section{Structure of the database tables}

The MagIC database is organized around a series of data tables.  The complete data model can be found here:
\url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/metadata.htm}.

  Each MagIC table has  a one line header of the form:


tab\hskip 2em{\bf table\_name}

\noindent
``tab'' (or ``tab delimited'') means that the table is tab delimited.  In theory other delimiters are possible, but {\bf PmagPy}  only  uses tab delimited formats.  The {\bf table\_name} is one of the table names. The tables are of four general types:  EarthRef tables ({\bf er\_}) shared in common with other EarthRef databases,  MagIC tables ({\bf magic\_})  common to both rock magnetic and paleomagnetic studies, Paleomagnetic tables ({\bf pmag\_}), data reduction useful in paleomagnetic studies, Rock magnetic tables ({\bf rmag\_}), data reduction useful for rock magnetic studies.    Most studies use only some of these tables.     Here are some useful tables for a typical paleomagnetic study (starred are required in all cases):

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
table\qquad &Brief description\\
\hline
{\bf er\_locations*}\qquad & geographic information about the location(s) of the study\\
 {\bf er\_sites}\qquad & locations, lithologic information, etc. for the sampling sites\\
 {\bf er\_samples}\qquad & orientation, sampling methods, etc. for samples\\
  {\bf er\_specimens}\qquad &specimen weights, volumes\\
    {\bf er\_ages}\qquad &age information.\\
    {\bf er\_images}\qquad & images associated with the study (field shots, sample\\
    \qquad &photos, photomicrographs, SEM images, etc.\\
   {\bf er\_mailinglist}\qquad &contact information for people involved in the study\\
   \hline
   {\bf magic\_measurements} \qquad & \hskip 1em measurement data used in the study\\
    {\bf magic\_instruments}\qquad & instruments used in the study\\
       \hline
    {\bf pmag\_specimens}\qquad & interpretations of best-fit lines, planes, paleointensity, etc. \\
{\bf pmag\_samples}\qquad &sample averages of specimen data\\
{\bf pmag\_sites}\qquad & site averages of sample data\\
{\bf pmag\_results}\qquad & averages, VGP/V[A]DM calculations, stability tests, etc.\\
{\bf pmag\_criteria}\qquad &criteria used in study for data selection\\
   \hline
   {\bf rmag\_susceptibility}\qquad &experiment for susceptibility parameters\\
{\bf rmag\_anisotropy}\qquad & summary of anisotropy parameters\\
{\bf rmag\_hysteresis}\qquad & summary of hysteresis parameters\\
{\bf rmag\_remanence}\qquad &summary of remanence parameters\\
{\bf rmag\_results}\qquad &summary results and highly derived data \\
\qquad &products (critical temperatures, etc.)\\
{\bf rmag\_criteria}\qquad &criteria used in study for data selection\\
\hline
\end{tabular}



The second line of every file contains the column headers (meta-data) describing the included data.   For example, an {\bf er\_sites} table might look like this:

{\hoffset -1in
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\hline
tab\hskip 2em{\bf er\_sites}\\
er\_site\_name \qquad & er\_location\_name \qquad &  site\_lithology \qquad & site\_type \qquad &  site\_lat \qquad & site\_lon\\
AZ01\qquad &Azores \qquad & basalt \qquad &lava flow \qquad & 37.80\qquad &-25.80\\
...\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}

Although data can be entered directly into Excel spreadsheets by hand, it is easier to generate the necessary tables as a by-product of ordinary data processing without having to know details of the meta-data and method codes.
The section on \href{#PmagPy}{PmagPy} describes how to use the {\bf PmagPy} software for  data analysis and generate the MagIC data tables automatically for the most common paleomagnetic studies involving directions and/or paleointensities.    See also \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.


\customlink{method_codes}

  \section{A word about  method codes}

  The MagIC database tags records with ``method codes'' which are short codes that describe various methods associated with a particular data record.  The complete list is available here:  \url{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/methods.htm}.      Most of the time, you do not need to know what these are (there are over a hundred!), but it is helpful to know something about them.  These are divided into several general categories like `geochronology methods' and  `field sampling methods'.   Method codes start with a few letters which designate the category (e.g., GM or FS  for geochronogy and field sampling respectively).   Then there is a second part and possibly also a third part to describe methods with lesser or greater detail.
The current (version 2.4) method codes that describe various lab treatment methods to give you a flavor for how they work are listed in this table:

   \begin{tabular}{lll}
  \hline
  LT-AF-D \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Alternating field: Double demagnetization\\
  \qquad &\qquad & with AF along X,Y,Z measurement \\
 \qquad &\qquad & followed by AF along -X,-Y,-Z measurement\\
LT-AF-G \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Alternating field: Triple demagnetization\\
\qquad &\qquad & with AF along Y,Z,X measurement\\
\qquad &\qquad & followed by AF along Y and AF along Z measurement\\
LT-AF-I \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Alternating field: In laboratory field\\
LT-AF-Z \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Alternating field: In zero field\\
LT-CHEM \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Cleaning of porous rocks by chemical leaching with HCl\\
LT-FC \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Specimen cooled with laboratory field on\\
LT-HT-I \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & High temperature treatment: In laboratory field\\
LT-HT-Z \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & High temperature treatment: In zero field\\
LT-IRM \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & IRM imparted to specimen prior to measurement\\
LT-LT-I \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Low temperature treatment: In laboratory field\\
LT-LT-Z \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Low temperature treatment: In zero field\\
LT-M-I \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Using microwave radiation: In laboratory field\\
LT-M-Z \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Using microwave radiation: In zero field\\
LT-NO \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & No treatments applied before measurement\\

LT-NRM-PAR \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Specimen heating and cooling: Laboratory \\
\qquad &\qquad &field parallel to the NRM vector\\
LT-NRM-PERP \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Specimen heating and cooling: \\

\qquad &\qquad & perform a zero field cooling at a lower temperature\\
LT-T-I \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Specimen cooling: In laboratory field\\
LT-T-Z \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Specimen cooling: In zero field\\
LT-VD \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Viscous demagnetization by applying MU-metal screening\\

LT-ZF-C \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Zero field cooled, low temperature IRM imparted\\
LT-ZF-CI \qquad & Lab Treatment \qquad & Zero field cooled, induced M measured on warming\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For uploading to the database, all the individual tables should be assembled into a single file.  Each individual data table is separated from the next by a series of `$>>>>>>>>>>$' symbols, so a typical upload file might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
tab   er_locations
location_type	er_citation_names	location_end_lat	location_begin_lon	er_location_name	location_begin_lat	location_end_lon
Drill Site	This study	19.0	156.0	801C	19.0	156.0
Drill Site	This study	19	156	801	19	156
>>>>>>>>>>
tab   er_samples
er_citation_names	sample_lithology	er_site_name	er_sample_name	sample_type	er_location_name	sample_lat	sample_lon	sample_class

This study   Submarine Basaltic Glass	17r1026	17r1026	Lava Flow	801C	19	156	Igneous: Extrusive
.
.
.
\end{verbatim}

Correctly formatted MagIC data tables can be assembled into a suitable upload text file by using the program \href{#upload_magic.py}{upload\_magic.py} which reads in all MagIC tables in a given directory and puts them together as in the above example.  You can invoke \href{#upload_magic.py}{upload\_magic.py} on the \href{#command_line}{command line} or call it within  \href{#pmag_gui.py}{Pmag GUI}.     \href{#upload_magic.py}{upload\_magic.py} creates a file called {\it upload\_magic.txt} which can be \href{#magic_upload}{uploaded into the MagIC database}.

%\section{Installing Python and PmagPy}
%\label{sect:python}
%
%
%
%Python can  be painful to install (but so can  all other programming environments).  There are  a few recipes that work for Mac OS (at least for 10.4 and later) and for Windows.  These recipes and ingredients are available through the website:
%
%\url{http://earthref.org/PmagPy}.
%
%
%
%Once Python is installed, \href{#command_line}{find your command line} with its prompt.    After the command prompt, type:  {\bf python} to start the interactive python shell.  To get back out again,   hold down the control key while typing the letter ``d''.  On Windows machines, you may have to substitute a letter ``c'' to achieve the same effect. This action will be referred to with  `ctrl-D' here.
%
% Everyone should now have the $>>>$ Python prompt.  Here is a transcript of a python interpreter session which should make a simple graph:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% python
%Enthought Python Distribution -- www.enthought.com
%Version: 7.1-2 (32-bit)
%
%Python 2.7.2 |EPD 7.1-2 (32-bit)| (default, Jul 27 2011, 13:29:32)
%[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] on darwin
%Type ``packages``, ``demo`` or ``enthought`` for more information.
%>>> import matplotlib
%>>> matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
%>>> import pylab
%>>> pylab.plot([1,2,3,4])
%[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x64eb270>]
%>>> pylab.show()
%
%\end{verbatim}
%
%which produces the fascinating graph:
%
%  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/matplotlib.eps}
%
%
%To kill the interpreter, close the plot window (red button) and type ctrl-D.
%
%
%If you don't get something about Enthought Python, you are probably using the standard Mac Os version, which has none of the whistles and bells we want (plotting, numerical packages, etc.), and you'll need to set your path properly. Look for hints at:
%\url{http://earthref.org/PmagPy}.     For more on how to program in Python, see Chapter~\ref{chap:python}.





\customlink{Python}

\chapter{Introduction to Python Programming}
\label{chap:python}

Type 'python' on your \href{#command_line}{command line}.

You have just fired up Python and  you are in an interactive mode with the prompt  {\color{blue}$>>>$}.  Now, you can just start typing commands. After each command, press the return key and see what happens:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> a=2
>>> a
2
>>> b=2
>>> c=a+b
>>> c
>>> c+=1
>>> c
5
>>> a=2; b=2; c=a+b; c
4
>>> d,e,f=4,5,6 # note syntax! d=4;e=5;f=6
>>> # note also that the symbol '#' means the rest of the line is a comment!
\end{verbatim}}

To get out of Python interactive mode and back to your beloved command line, type the control key (here-after  {\color{blue}\^{ }}) and  {\color{blue}D} at the same time.
From your  school experience of Algebra, you will recognize $a, b,$ and $c$ in the above session as {\it variables} and $+$ as an {\it operation}. If you have previous programming experience, you may have been surprised that we didn't declare variables up front (C programmers always have to).  And, the variables above are obviously behaving as integers, not floating point variables (no decimals) but they are not letters between $i$ and $n$.  And there were funny lines that seemed to set three numbers at once:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> a=2; b=2; c=a+b; c
and
>>> d,e,f=4,5,6 # note syntax! d=4;e=5;f=6
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
Here are some rules governing variables and operations in Python:


\begin{itemize}
\item Variable names are composed of alphanumeric characters, including `-` and '\_'.
\item They are case sensitive:  `a' is not the same as 'A'.
\item They do NOT have to be specified in advance (unlike C)
\item In fortran, integers are  $i-n$ and floating points are all else - not the case in Python. You can make them whatever you want.
\item + adds, - subtracts, * multiplies, / divides, \% gives the remainder, ** raises to the power
\item These two are fun: {\color{blue}+=} and  {\color{blue}-=}.  They add to and subtract from respectively.
\item Parentheses determine order of operation (as in any reasonable programming language).
\item  For math functions, we can use various modules that either come standard with python (the math module) or are additions that come with the Enthought Python Edition we are using (the NumPy module).  A module is just a collection of functions. NB:  There is online help for any python function or method:  just type help(FUNC).
\end{itemize}


\section{A first look at NumPy}

O.K.  First of all - how do you pronounce `NumPy'.  According to Important People at Enthought (e.g, Robert Kern), it should be pronounced ``Num'' as in ``Number'' and ``Pie'' as in, well, pie, or Python.  Oops.  It is way more fun to say Numpee!

So, that out of the way, what can NumPy do for us?  Turns out, a whole heck of a lot!  But for now we will just scratch the surface.   It can, for example, give us the value of $\pi$ as {\color{blue}numpy.pi}.  Note how the module name comes first, then the name of the function we wish to use.  In this case, the function just returns the value of $\pi$.

To use {\color{blue}NumPy} functions, we must first ``import'' the module with the command {\color{blue}import}.  The first time you do this after installing Python, it may take a while, but after that it should be very quick.

There are four styles of the import command which all do pretty much the same thing but differ in how you have to call the function after importing:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>>  import numpy
>>> numpy.pi
3.1415926535897931
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
This makes all the functions in NumPy available to you, but you have to call them with the {\color{blue}numpy.FUNC} syntax.

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>>  import numpy as np  # or anything else!  e.g., some use:  N
>>> np.pi  # or N.pi in the second case.
3.1415926535897931
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
This does the same as the first, but allows you to call NumPy anything you want - to save typing?
\noindent
To import all the functions from NumPy and not have to type numpy at all:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> from numpy  import *
>>> pi
3.1415926535897931
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
This imports all the umpty-ump functions, which is a heavy load on your memory,  but you can also just import a few, like {\color{blue}pi} or {\color{blue}sqrt}:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> from numpy import pi, sqrt # pi and square root
>>> pi
3.1415926535897931
>>> sqrt(4)
2.0
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Did you notice how {\color{blue}sqrt(4)} where 4 was an integer, returned a floating point variable (2.0)?

{\color{magenta}Good housekeeping Tip \#1: We tend to import modules using the first option above.  That way we know what module the functions I'm using are coming from - especially because we don't know off-hand ALL the functions available in any given module and there might be conflicts with my own function names or two different modules could have the same function (like} {\color{blue}math} {\color{magenta}and }{\color{blue}numpy}).


Here is a (partial) list of some useful {\color{blue}NumPy} functions:


\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
absolute(x)  \qquad & absolute value\\
arccos(x)    \qquad & arccosine\\
arcsin(x)    \qquad & arcsine\\
arctan(x)    \qquad & arctangent\\
arctan2(y,x)  \qquad &arctangent of y/x in correct quadrant (***very useful!)\\
cos(x)        \qquad &cosine\\
cosh(x)      \qquad & hyperbolic cosine\\
exp(x)      \qquad &  exponential\\
log(x)      \qquad &  natural logarithm\\
log10(x)    \qquad &  base 10 log\\
sin(x)       \qquad & sine\\
sinh(x)     \qquad &  hyperbolic sine\\
sqrt(x)    \qquad &   square root\\
tan(x)      \qquad &  tangent\\
tanh(x)    \qquad &   hyperbolic tangent\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\noindent
Note that  in the trigonometric functions,  the argument is in RADIANS!.You can convert from degrees to radians by multiplying by:  {\color{blue}numpy.pi/180.}.  Also notice how these functions have parentheses, as opposed to {\color{blue}numpy.pi} which has none.  The difference is that these take arguments, while  {\color{blue}numpy.pi} just returns the value of $\pi$.


\noindent
If you are desperate, you can always use your Python interpreter as a calculator:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy
>>> a=2
>>> b=-12
>>> c=16
>>> quad1 = (-b + numpy.sqrt(b**2-4.*a*c))/(2.*a)
>>> quad1
4
>>> y=numpy.sin(numpy.pi/6.)
>>> y
0.5
\end{verbatim}}


\section{Variable types}

The time has come to talk about variable types.  We've been very relaxed up to now, because we don't have to declare them up front and we can often even change them from one type to another on the fly.  But - variable types matter, so here goes. Python has integer, floating point (both long and short), string and complex variable types.  It is pretty clever about figuring out what is required.   Here are some examples:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> number=1 # an integer
>>> Number=1.0 # a floating point
>>> NUMBER='1' # a string
>>> complex=1j # a complex number with imaginary part 1
>>> complex(3,1) # the complex number 3+1i
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
{Try doing math with these!}
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> number+number
2     [ an integer]
>>> number+Number
2.0   [ a float]
>>> NUMBER+NUMBER
11 [a string]
>>> number+NUMBER  [Gives you an angry error message]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
 Lesson learned: you can't add a number and a string.  and string addition is different!  But you really have to be careful with this.  If you multiply a float by an integer, it is possible that you will convert the float to an integer when you really wanted all those numbers after the decimal! So, if you want a float, use a float.

{ You can convert from one type to another (if appropriate) with:}
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
 int(Number); str(number);  float(NUMBER);
 long(Number); complex(real,imag)
 \end{verbatim}}

\noindent
{\color{blue}long()} converts to a double precision floating point and {\color{blue}complex()} converts the two parts to a complex number.

 There is another kind of variable called ``boolean''. These are: {\color{blue}true}, {\color{blue}false}, {\color{blue}and}, {\color{blue}or}, and {\color{blue}not}.
For the record, the integer  `1' is {\color{blue}true} and  `0' is {\color{blue}false}.
These can be used to control the flow of the program as we shall learn later.

\section{Data Structures}

In previous programming experience, you may have encountered arrays, which are a nice way to group a sequence of numbers that belong together.  In Python  we also have arrays, but we also have more flexible data structures, like lists, tuples, and dictionaries,  that group arbitrary variables together, like strings and integers and floats - whatever you want really. We'll go through some attributes of the various data structures, starting with lists.

\subsubsection{Lists}
%%\vskip -.25in
\begin{itemize}
\item Lists are denoted with square brackets,  [ ],  and can contain any arbitrary set of items, including other lists!
\item Items in the list are referred to by an index number, starting with 0.
\item You can  count from the end to the beginning by starting with -1 (the last item in the list), -2 (second to last), etc.
\item Items can be sorted, deleted, inserted, sliced, counted, concatenated, replaced, added on, etc.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Examples:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> mylist=[`a',2.0,`400',`spam',42,[24,2]] # defines a list
>>> mylist[2] # refers to the third item
`400'
>>> mylist[-1] # refers to the last item
[24,2]
>>> mylist[1]=26.3   # replaces the second item
>>> del mylist[3] # deletes the fourth element
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent
To slice out a chunk of the middle of a list:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> newlist=mylist[1:3]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
This takes items 2 and 3 out (note it takes out up to but not including the last item number - don't ask me why).
Or, we can slice it this way:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> newlist=mylist[3:]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
which takes from the fourth item (starting from 0!) to the end.


To copy a list BEWARE! You can make  a copy - but it isn't an independent copy (like in, e.g.,  Fortran), but it is just another name for the SAME OBJECT, so:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> mycopy=mylist
>>>mylist[2]=`new'
>>>mycopy[2]
`new'
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
See how mycopy got changed when we changed mylist?
\noindent
To spawn a new list that is a copy, but an independent entity:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>>mycopy=mylist[:]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
Now try:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>>mylist[2]=1003
>>>mycopy[2]
`new'
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
So now {\color{blue}mycopy}  stayed the way it was, even as {\color{blue}mylist } changed.


Python is ``object oriented'', a popular concept in coding circles.  We'll learn more about what that means later, but for right now you can walk around feeling smug that you are learning an object oriented programming language.   O.K., what is an object?  Well,
{\color{blue}mylist} is an object.   Cool.  What do objects have that might be handy?
Objects have ``methods'' which allow you to do things to them.  Methods have the form:
{\color{blue}object.method()}

\noindent
Here are two examples:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> mylist.append(`me too') # appends a string to mylist
>>> mylist.sort() # sorts the list alphanumerically
>>> mylist
[2.0, 42, [24, 2], '400', 'a', 'me too', 'spam']
\end{verbatim}}
%%\vskip .25in


\noindent

 For a complete list of methods for lists, see:
\url{http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists}

\subsubsection{More about strings}
Numbers are numbers. While there are more kinds of numbers (complex, etc.),
strings can be  more interesting. Unlike in some languages, they can be denoted with single, double or triple quotes:  e.g.,
`spam',  ``Sam's spam'', or
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
``````
Hi there we can type as
many lines as we want
``````
\end{verbatim}}

Strings can be added together ({\color{blue}newstring = 'spam' + 'alot'}).  They  can be sliced ({\color{blue}newerstring = newstring[0:3]}).
but they CANNOT be changed in place - you can't do this: {{\color{blue}newstring[0]='b'}.
To find more of the things you can and cannot do to strings, see:

\url{http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html#strings}

\subsubsection{Data structures as objects}



\subsubsection{Tuples}
What?  Tuples?
Tuples consist of a number of values separated by commas.  They are denoted with parentheses.
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> t = 1234, 2.0, `hello'
>>> t
(1234, 2.0, `hello')
>>> t[0]
1234
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent Tuples are sort of like lists, but like strings, their elements cannot be changed.  However, you can slice, concatenate, etc.
 For more see:

\url{ http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences}




\subsubsection {Dictionaries!}

Dictionaries are denoted by \{\}.  They are also somewhat like lists, but instead of integer indices, they use alphanumeric `keys':
I love dictionaries.  So here is a bit more about them.

\noindent
To define one:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> Telnos={`lisa':46084,`lab':46531,`jeff':44707} # defines a dictionary
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
To return the value associated with a specific key:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> Telnos[`lisa']
46084
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
 To change a key value:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> Telnos['lisa']=46048
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent
To add a new key value:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> Telnos[`newguy']=48888
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent
 Dictionaries also have some methods.
One useful one is:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> Telnos.keys()
[`lisa',`lab',`jeff',`newguy']
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
which returns a list of all the keys.

For a more complete accounting of dictionaries,  see:

\url{http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries}



\subsubsection{N-dimensional arrays}

Arrays  in Python  have many similarities  to  lists.
Unlike lists, however,  arrays have to be all of the same data type (dtype), usually numbers (integers or floats), although there appears to be something called a character array.  Also, the size and shape of an array must be known {\it a priori} and not determined on the fly like lists. For example we can define a list with {\color{blue}L=[]}, then append to it as desired, but not so arrays - they are much pickier and we'll see how to set them up later.

Why use arrays when you can use lists?  They are far more efficient than lists particularly for things like matrix math.   But just to make things a little confusing, there are  several different data objects that are loosely called arrays, e.g., arrays, character arrays and matrices.  These are all subclasses of ndarray.  I'm just going to briefly introduce arrays and matrices here.

 Here are a few ways of making arrays:
%%\vskip -.35in
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy
>>> A= numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,2,0],[1,1,2]])
>>> A
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 2, 0],
       [1, 1, 2]])
>>> B=numpy.arange(0,10,1).reshape(2,5)
>>> B
array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
       [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
>>> C=numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],numpy.int32)
>>> C
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]])
>>> D=numpy.zeros((2,3)) # Notice the zeros and the size is specified by a tuple.
>>> D
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.]])
>>> E=numpy.ones((2,4))
>>> E
array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]])
>>> F=numpy.linspace(0,10,14)
>>> F
array([  0.        ,   0.76923077,   1.53846154,   2.30769231,
         3.07692308,   3.84615385,   4.61538462,   5.38461538,
         6.15384615,   6.92307692,   7.69230769,   8.46153846,
         9.23076923,  10.        ])
>>> G=numpy.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float)
>>> G   # note how this is initalized with really low numbers (but not zeros).
array([[  1.90979621e-313,   2.75303490e-308],
       [  1.08539798e-071,   3.05363949e-309]])
\end{verbatim}}

Note the difference between {\color{blue}linspace(start,stop,N)} and {\color{blue}arange(start,stop,step)}. The function {\color{blue}linspace} creates an array with 14 evenly spaced elements between the start and stop values while  {\color{blue}arange} creates an array with elements at {color{blue}step} intervals between the starting and stopping values.    In some of the online examples you will find the short-cuts for {\color{blue}arange()} and {\color{blue}linspace} as  {\color{blue}r\_(-5,5,20j)} and {\color{blue}r\_(-5,5,1.)} respectively.

Python arrays have methods like {\color{blue}dtype},  {\color{blue}ndim}, {\color{blue}shape}, {\color{blue}size}, {\color{blue}reshape()}, {\color{blue}ravel()},  {\color{blue}transpose()} etc.    Did you notice how some of these require parentheses and some don't? The answer is that some of these are functions and some are classes, both of which we will get to later.

Let's see what the methods can do.
First,  arrays made in the above example are of different data types. To find out what data type an array is, just use the method {\color{blue}dtype} as in:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> D.dtype
dtype('float64')
>>>
\end{verbatim}}



 And of course  arrays, unlike lists have dimensions and shape.  Dimensions tell us how many axes there are with axes defined as in this illustration:

   \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/ndim.eps}

   As shown above our {\color{blue}A} array has two dimensions (axis 0 and 1).  To get Python to tell us this, we use the {\color{blue}ndim} method:

   { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>>  A= numpy.array([[1,2,3],[4,2,0],[1,1,2]]) # just to remind you
>>> A.ndim
2
\end{verbatim}}
Notice how {\color{blue}zeros, ones} and {\color{blue}ndarray} used a shape tuple in order to define the arrays in the examples above.   The shape of an array is how many elements are along each axis.  So, naturally we see that the C array is a 2x3 array.  Python returns a tuple with the shape information using the {\color{blue}shape} method:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> C.shape
(2, 3)
\end{verbatim}}

Let's say we don't want a 2x3 array for the sequence in the array {\color{blue}C}, but we want a 3x2 array.  Python can reshape an array with a different shape tuple like this:
   { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> C.reshape((3,2))
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4],
       [5, 6]])
\end{verbatim}}

And sometimes we just want all the elements lined up along one axis. We could do that with {\color{blue}reshape} of course using a tuple  with the size of the array (the total number of elements). You  can see that this is 6 here. We could even get python to tell us what the size is ({\color{blue}C.size}) and use that in the reshape size tuple.  Alternatively we can use the {\color{blue}ravel()} method which doesn't require us to know the size in advance:

   { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> C.ravel()
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
\end{verbatim}}

There are other ways to reshape, slice and dice arrays.
The syntax for slicing of arrays is similar to that for lists:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> B=A[0:2] # carve the top two lines off of matrix A from above
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]])
\end{verbatim}}

Lots of applications in Earth Science require the transpose of an array:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> A.transpose() # this is the same as A.T
array([[1, 4, 7],
       [2, 5, 8],
       [3, 6, 9]])
\end{verbatim}}

Also, we can concatenate two arrays together with the - you guessed it - {\color{blue}concatenate()} method.   For a lot more tricks with arrays, go to the NumPy Reference website here:  \url{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/}.


To convert the {\color{blue}A} array to a list:   {\color{blue}L=A.tolist()},  from a list or tuple to an array:   {\color{blue}A=numpy.array(L)}, or from a list, a tuple or an array to a NumPy array:   {\color{blue}a=numpy.asarray(L)}

Let's go a bit deeper into slicing of arrays.  First a review of lists.   You will recall that in  python, indexing starts with 0, so for the list {\color{blue} L=[0,2,4,6,8], L[1]} is 2. The index of the last item is -1, so  {\color{blue}L[-1]}=8.  To find out what the index for the number 4 is, for example, we have the {\color{blue}index()} method:  {\color{blue}L.index(4}), which will return the number 2. We actually already used this method when we implemented command line arguments, but it wasn't really explained.   We know that to reassign a given index a new value we use the syntax {\color{blue}L[1]=2.5}.
And to use a part of a list (a slice) we use, e.g.,    {\color{blue}B=L[2:4]}, which  defines  {\color{blue}B} as a list with  {\color{blue}L}'s elements 2 and 3 (4 and 6).  And you also know that  {\color{blue}B=L[2:]} takes all the elements from 2 to the end.
From these examples, you can infer that the basic syntax for slicing is  {\color{blue}[start:stop:step]}; if the step is omitted it is assumed to be 1.

Arrays (and matrices) work in a similar fashion to lists, but these are multidimensional objects, so things get hairy fast.
The basic syntax is the same:  {\color{blue}[start:stop:step]},  or  {\color{blue}i:j:k}.   but with Python arrays, we step through all the  {\color{blue}j}'s for each  {\color{blue}i}  at step  {\color{blue}k}.  This is best shown with examples:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy
>>> A=numpy.linspace(0,29,30)
>>> B=A.reshape(5,6)
array([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.,   4.,   5.],
       [  6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
       [ 12.,  13.,  14.,  15.,  16.,  17.],
       [ 18.,  19.,  20.,  21.,  22.,  23.],
       [ 24.,  25.,  26.,  27.,  28.,  29.]])
>>> B[1:3,:-1:2]
array([[  6.,   8.,  10.],
       [ 12.,  14.,  16.]])
\end{verbatim}}

Let's pick about the statement {\color{blue}B[1:3,:-1:2]} to see if we can understand what it does.  The first part alone returns lines 2 and 3:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> B[1:3]
array([[  6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.,  11.],
       [ 12.,  13.,  14.,  15.,  16.,  17.]])
\end{verbatim}}

Here  {\color{blue}j} goes from [:-1], in other words, we all but the last element:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> B[1:3,:-1]
array([[  6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.],
       [ 12.,  13.,  14.,  15.,  16.]])
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent And finally, we have the step of 2, which takes every other element:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> B[1:3,:-1:2]
array([[  6.,   8.,  10.],
       [ 12.,  14.,  16.]])
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent For more on array slicing (indexing), see:

\url{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html}

\customlink{pandas}



\section{Pandas}

Now that you have fallen in love with Python and Numpy, we have a new treat for you:  pandas.  Pandas is a powerful module available with the Python distribution that you should have installed in the \href{#quick_start}{Installing PmagPy} section.  It supports elegant data structures and tools for wrangling the data which allow fast and user-friendly data analysis.  There are two basic data structures:  the Series (a one-dimensional array like object that is a data array with an associated array of indices which can be numbers or text) and the DataFrame (a spreadsheet like data table).

First, invoke pandas by importing it, then create some data Series using several approaches:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> import pandas
>>> obj = pandas.Series([1,2,3,4]) # create first pandas object with numeric indices
>>> obj
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64
>>> obj2=pandas.Series([1,2,3,4],index=['a','b','c','d']) # create second pandas object with text indices
>>> obj2
a    1
b    2
c    3
d    4
dtype: int64
>>> Telnos={'lisa':46084,'lab':46531,'jeff':44707} # create a dictionary
>>> obj3=pandas.Series(Telnos) # create a pandas Series from the dictionary.
>>> obj3
jeff    44707
lab     46531
lisa    46084
dtype: int64
\end{verbatim}}


Another very useful pandas object is the DataFrame.  These have both row and column indices and are like a dictionary of Series so are much more flexible than the Numpy array objects.   Here is an example:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> data={'telnos':['44707','46531','46084'],
...        'names':['jeff','lisa','lab'],
...        'rooms':['300D RH','300E RH','1162 SvH']}
>>> frame=pandas.DataFrame(data)
>>> frame
  names     rooms telnos
0  jeff   300D RH  44707
1  lisa   300E RH  46531
2   lab  1162 SvH  46084
 \end{verbatim}}

There are many methods associated with pandas objects which allow searching, massaging and generally fiddling with the data.   You should check out some of the many tutorials on pandas on the web.

\section{Python Scripts}

Are you tired of typing yet? Python scripts are programs that can be run and re-run from the command line.
You can type in the same stuff you've been doing interactively into a script file (ending in .py). You can edit scripts with your favorite text editor (NOT Word!).   And then you can run them like this:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
%python < myscript.py
\end{verbatim}}

On a Mac or Unix system,  you can put in a header line identifying the script as python (\#!/usr/bin/env python), make  it executable (chmod a+x)  and   run it like this:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ myscript.py
\end{verbatim}}

On PCs, you can just type the name of the script without the header or the chmod command.   But, because PCs don't come standard with a {\bf cat} command, you have to create the file with Notepad, instead of with {\bf cat} for all the examples using {\bf cat}.

Here is an example that creates a script using the Unix {\bf cat} command, makes it executable and then runs it:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ cat > printmess.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
# simple Python test program (printmess.py)
print 'test message'
^-D
$ chmod a+x printmess.py
$ ./printmess.py
test message
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
In a Python script on Unix machines (including MacOS), the  first line MUST be:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#! /usr/bin/env python
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
so that the file is interpreted as Python.  Unlike Fortran or C, you CANNOT start with a
comment line (try switching lines 1 and 2 and see what happens).

The second line is a comment line.  Anything to the right of \# is assumed to be a comment.
Notice that print goes by default to your screen.  Because the message is a string, you can use single or double quotes
for the test message.  You can get an apostrophe in your output by using double quotes
and quote marks by using single quotes, i.e.,

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#! /usr/bin/env python
# simple Python test program 2 (printmess2.py)
print ``The pump don't work 'cuz the vandals took the handles``
print 'She said ``I know what it\'s like to be dead``'
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
produces:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ./printmess2.py
The pump don't work 'cuz the vandals took the handles
She said ``I know what it's like to be dead``
%
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
In the second print statement, the $\backslash$' is necessary to prevent an error (try it).   This is an example of a Python `escape code'.   These are used to escape some special meaning, as in an end-quote for a string in this example. We use the backslash to say that we really really want a quote mark here.   Other escape codes are listed here:

\url{http://www.python-course.eu/variables.php}

Here's another example of a program - this one has an typo in line 4:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#! /usr/bin/env python
abeg = 2.1
aend = 3.9
adif = aend - abge
print 'adif = ', adif
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
You had intended to type 'abeg' but typed 'abge' instead.  When
you run the program, you get an error message:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ``./undeclared.py``, line 4, in <module>
    adif = aend - abge
NameError: name 'abge' is not defined
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
Error messages are a desirable feature of Python.  You don't want the program
to run by assigning some arbitrary value to abge and giving you
a wrong answer.  Yet many languages will do exactly that.


\section{Code blocks}
Any reasonable programming language must provide a way to group blocks of code together, to be executed under certain conditions.  In Fortran, for example, there are if statements and do loops which are bounded by the statements if, endif and do, endo respectively.  Many of these programs encourage the use of indentation to make the code more readable, but do not require it.  In Python, indentation is the way that code blocks are defined - there are no terminating statements. Also, the initiating statement terminates in a colon.  The trick is that all code indented the same number of spaces (or tabs) to the right belong together.  The code block terminates when the next line is less indented.     A typical Python program looks like this:

{ \color{blue}\begin {verbatim}
program statement
block 1 top statement:
    block 1 statement
    block 1 statement \
        ha-ha i can break the indentation convention!
    block 1 statement
    block 2 top statement:
        block 2 statement
        block 2 statement
        block 3 top statement:
            block 3 statement
            block 3 statement
            block 4 top statement: block 4 single line of code
        block 2 statement
        block 2 statement
    block 1 statement
    block 1 statement
program statement
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent Exceptions to the code indentation rules are:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Any statement can be continued on the next line with the continuation character $\backslash$ and the indentation of the following line is arbitrary.  \item If a code block consists of a single statement, then that may be placed on the same line as the colon.
\item The command {\color{blue}break} breaks you out of the code block. Use with caution!
\item There is a cheat that comes in handy when you are writing a complicated program and want to put in the code blocks but don't want them to DO anything yet:  the command  {\color{blue} pass} does nothing and can be used to stand in for a code block.
\end{itemize}

{ \color{magenta}Good housekeeping Tip \#2: Always use only spaces or only tabs in your code indentation. We use only spaces because we use {\color{blue}vi} to write my code.  Others use Xcode, the  Python IDLE program, or TextWrangler to write their code and some of these things use tabs by default.  Whatever you do BE CONSISTENT because tabs are not the same as spaces in Python even if you can't tell the difference just by looking at it.}




In the following, I'll show you how Python uses code blocks  to create ``do'' and ``while'' loops, and ``if'' statements.

\subsubsection{The for loop}
\subsubsection{Looping through lists}

Here is an example of a simple  ``for loop'':


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
mylist=[42,`spam',`ocelot']
for i in range(0,len(mylist),1): # note absence of Indices list, start and step
   print mylist[i]
print 'All done'
\end{verbatim}}

This script creates the list mylist with the line {\color{blue}mylist=[42,`spam',`ocelot']}.  The length of mylist is an integer value returned by {\color{blue}len(mylist)}.      The script uses this integer as the `stop' value in the  {\color{blue}range()} function,  which returns a list of integers from 0 to the stop value  MINUS ONE at intervals of one.   [ The minus one convention is hard to get use to  for Fortran programmers, but it is typical of Python syntax (and also of C) so just deal with it.]  Anyway, {\color{blue}range(start,stop,step)} is just like {\color{blue}numpy.arange(start,stop,step)} but returns integers instead of floats.  Also, like {\color{blue}numpy.arange()}, there is a short hand form when the minimum is zero and the interval is one, so we could (and will)  just use the command {\color{blue}range(stop)}.

   Python makes $i$ step through the list of numbers from 0 to 2, printing the $i^{th}$ element of {\color{blue}mylist}.  Note how the print command is indented - this is the program block that is executed for each $i$.   Note also that the line could have been on the previous line after the colon, because there is only one line in the program block.  But never-mind, this way works too.   When $i$ finishes it's business, the program block terminates.   At that point, the program prints out the 'All done' string.   There is no ``enddo'' statement or equivalent in Python.

But, Python is far more fun than the old-school {\color{blue}for i in} syntax in the above code snippet.  In Python we can just step through a list directly.  Here is another  script which does just that (why not?):

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
mylist=[42,`spam',`ocelot']
for item in mylist: # note absence of range statement
    print item
print 'All done'
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent Note that of course we could have used any variable name instead of `item', but it makes sense to use variable names that mean what they do.  It is easier to understand what `item' stands for than just the Fortran style of $i$.

Here is an example with a little more heft to it.  It creates a table of trigonometry functions, spitting them out with a formatted print statement:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#! /usr/bin/env python
import numpy as np
deg2rad = np.pi/180. # remember conversion to radians
for theta in range(90): # short form of range, returns [0,1,2...89]
   ctheta = np.cos(theta*deg2rad) # define ctheta as cosine of theta
   stheta = np.sin(theta*deg2rad)# define stheta as  sine of theta
   ttheta = np.tan(theta*deg2rad)   # define ttheta as tangent of theta
   print '%5.1f %8.4f %8.4f %8.4f' %(theta, ctheta, stheta, ttheta)
 \end{verbatim}}

 Let's pick this one apart a bit.  First,
notice the use of the variable {\color{blue}deg2rad} to convert from degrees to radians.  Also notice how deg2rad is defined: {\color{blue}deg2rad = np.pi/180.} using the {\color{blue}NumPy} function for $\pi$ and the decimal point after 180.  While in this case, it makes absolutely no difference (try it!), it is a good practice to use real numbers if you want your variable to stay real.  In fact:

{\color{magenta}Good housekeeping Tip \#3:  Always use a decimal if you want your variable to be a floating point variable.}

The expression {\color{blue} ctheta = np.cos(theta*deg2rad)} uses the {\color{blue}numpy} cosine function. Ideally {\color{blue} theta} should be a real variable while in fact it is an integer
  in this expression, but fortunately Python figures that out and converts it to a real.   Note that we could have also converted theta to a float first with the command {\color{blue}float(theta)}.

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
print '%5.1f %8.4f %8.4f %8.4f' %(theta, ctheta, stheta, ttheta)
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent To make the output look nice, we do not use

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
print theta, ctheta, stheta, ttheta
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent which would space the numbers irregularly among the columns and put out really long numbers.  Instead,
we explicitly specify the output format.   The output format is given in the quotes.  The format for each
number follows the \%, 5.1f is for 5 spaces of floating point output, with 1
space to the right of the decimal point.  The single
blank space between \%5.1f and \%8.4f is included in the output, in fact any
text there is reproduced exactly in the output, thus to put commas between
the output numbers, write:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
print '%5.1f, %8.4f, %8.4f, %8.4f' %(theta, ctheta, stheta, ttheta)
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent Tabs ($\backslash$t) would be formatted like this:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
print '%5.1f '\t' %8.4f'\t'  %8.4f,\t' %8.4f' %(theta, ctheta, stheta, ttheta)
\end{verbatim}  }

 \subsubsection{Looping through arrays}

We just learned that  {\color{blue} for} loops with lists  just step through item by item.  In n-dimensional arrays, they steps through row by row (like in slicing).  For example,


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> for r in B:
...    print r
...
[ 0.  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.]
[  6.   7.   8.   9.  10.  11.]
[ 12.  13.  14.  15.  16.  17.]
[ 18.  19.  20.  21.  22.  23.]
[ 24.  25.  26.  27.  28.  29.]
\end{verbatim}}

If you really want to step through element by element, you can use the {\color{blue}ravel()} method which flattens an N-dimensional array to a single dimension:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> for e in B.ravel():
...    print  e
...
0.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
etc.
\end{verbatim}}

For more on looping (or iterating), see:

\url{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.nditer.html}



\subsubsection{If and while blocks}

The ``for loop'' is just one way of controlling flow in Python.  There are also {\color{blue}if}  and  {\color{blue}while} code blocks.  These execute code blocks  the same way as for loops (colon terminated top statements, indented text, etc.).  For both of these, the code block is executed if the top statement is  TRUE.  For the ``if'' block, the code is executed once but in a ``while'' block, the code keeps executing as long as the statement remains TRUE.

The key to flow control therefore is in the top statement of each code block;  if it is TRUE, then execute, otherwise skip it.  To decide if something is TRUE or not (in the boolean sense), we need to evaluate a statement using comparisons.   Here's a handy table with comparisons (relational operators) in different languages:

\centerline{Comparisons}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\hline
F 77  \qquad &   F90    \qquad &  C    \qquad & MATLAB  \qquad & PYTHON  \qquad & meaning\\
\hline
.eq.  \qquad &  ==   \qquad &   ==    \qquad &  ==  \qquad &     ==   \qquad &  equals\\
.ne. \qquad &   /=  \qquad &    !=   \qquad &   $\sim$=    \qquad &   !=  \qquad &   does not equal\\
.lt.  \qquad &  $<$   \qquad &    <$<$  \qquad &     $<$  \qquad &   $<$  \qquad &    less than\\
.le.  \qquad &  $<$= \qquad &     $<$=   \qquad &  $<$=   \qquad &    $<$=  \qquad &   less than or equal to\\
.gt.  \qquad & $>$ \qquad &      $>$    \qquad &   $>$    \qquad & $>$   \qquad &    greater than\\
.ge.  \qquad &  $>$ =   \qquad &   $>$ =   \qquad &  $>$ =  \qquad &    $>$ =  \qquad &   greater than or equal to\\
.and. \qquad & .and. \qquad &   \&\qquad &    \qquad &  \&  \qquad &      and\\
.or.  \qquad & .or.  \qquad &    ||    \qquad &  |   \qquad &     or \\
\hline
\end{tabular}


These operators can be combined to make complex tests.  Here is a juicy complicated statement:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
   if ( (a > b and c <= 0) or d == 0):
       code block
   \end{verbatim}}
\noindent
There are rules for the order of operations for these things like, multiplication gets done before addition.   But these are easy to forget.  You can look it up in the documentation if
you are unsure or, better, just put in enough parenthesis to
make it completely clear to anyone reading your code.

\noindent
{\color{magenta}Good housekeeping Tip \#4: Use parentheses liberally - make the order of operation completely unambiguous even if you could get away with fewer. }


One nice aspect of Python compared to C is that if you make
a mistake and type, for example,

{\color{blue}   \begin{verbatim}
      if (a = 0):
         \end{verbatim}}

\noindent you will get an error message during compilation.  In C this
is a valid statement with a completely different meaning
than is intended!


\subsubsection{Finer points of `if' blocks}

The simplest `if' block works just like we have described:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
if (2+2)==4: # note the use of '==' and parentheses in comparison statement
   print `I can put two and two together!'
\end{verbatim}}

However, as in  any other reasonable programming language, there are whistles and bells to the `if' code blocks.  In Python these are:  {\color{blue}elif} and {\color{blue}else}.
A code block gets executed if the top {\color{blue}if} statement is FALSE and the  {\color{blue}elif}  statement is TRUE.  If both the top {\color{blue}if} and the {\color{blue}elif}  statements are FALSE but the  {\color{blue}else}  statement is TRUE, then Python will execute the block following the  {\color{blue}else}.  Consider these examples:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
mylist=['jane','doug','denise']
if 'susie' in mylist:
    pass # don't do anything
if 'susie' not in mylist:
   print 'call susie and apologize!'
   mylist.append('susie')
elif 'george' in mylist: # if first statement is false, try this one
    print 'susie and george both in list'
else: # if both statements are false, do this:
   print ``susie in list but george isn't``
\end{verbatim}}

\subsubsection{While loops}

As already mentioned, the `while' block  continues executing as long as the {\color{blue}while}  top statement is TRUE.  In other words, the if block is only executed once, while the {\color{blue}while}  block keeps looping until the statement turns FALSE.    Here are a few examples:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
a=1
while a < 10:
    print a
    a+=1
print ``I'm done counting!``
\end{verbatim}}

\subsubsection{Code blocks in interactive Python}

All of these program blocks can also be done in an interactive session also using indentation.  The interactive shell responds with '.....'  instead of '$>>>$' once you type a statement it recognizes as a top statement.   To signal that you are done with the program block, simply hit return:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> a=1
>>> while a<10:
....    print a
....    a+=1
....[return to execute block]
\end{verbatim}}



\section{File I/O in Python}

Python would be no better than a rather awkward graphing calculator (and we haven't even gotten to the graphing part yet) if we couldn't read data in and spit data out.   You learned a rudimentary way of spitting stuff out already using the {\color{blue}print} statement, but there is a lot more to file I/O in Python.  We would like to be able to read in a variety of file formats  and output the data any way we want.  In the following we will explore some of the more useful  I/O options in Python.




\subsubsection{Reading data in}
\subsubsection{From a file}
\customlink{raw_input}

If you are using Python interactively or want interactivity in a script,  use the command:  {\color{blue}raw\_input()}.  It acts as a prompt and reads in whatever is supplied prior to a return as a string.

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
X=[] # make a list to put the data in
ans=float(raw_input(``Input numeric value for X:  ``))
X.append(ans) # append the value to X
print X[-1] # print the last item in the list
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
In this example, the variable {\color{blue}ans} will be read in as a string variable,  converted to a float and appended to the list, {\color{blue}X}.    {\color{blue}raw\_input()} is a simple but rather annoying way to enter things into a program.
Another (less annoying)  way is  put the data in a file (e.g., myfile.txt) with cat, paste, Excel (saved as a text file), or whatever and read  it into Python.  The procedure is straight-forward: we must first open the file, then read it in and parse lines into the desired variables.

To open a file we use the command {\color{blue}open()}, one of Python's built-in functions.  For a complete list of these, see:

\url{http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html}

\noindent  The  {\color{blue}open()} function returns an object,  complete with methods, like {\color{blue}readlines()} which, yes, reads all the lines.   Suppose you have a file containing the coordinates of some
seismic stations which you want to plot on a map or something. (In fact, it is in the {\it data\_files/LearningPython} directory.   The file
is called {\color{blue}   station.list} and its first five lines are:

{\color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
   9.02920   38.76560 2442 AAE
  42.63900   74.49400 1645 AAK
  37.93040   58.11890  678 ABKT
  51.88370 -176.68440  116 ADK
 -13.90930 -171.77730  706 AFI
 \end{verbatim}}
Here is a script ({\color{blue}ReadStations.py} that will open a file  {\color{blue}station.list}, read in the data and print it out line by line.
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
f=open('station.list')
StationNFO=f.readlines()
for line  in StationNFO:
    print line
\end{verbatim}}

If you run this script, you will get this behavior:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ReadStations.py
   9.02920   38.76560 2442 AAE

  42.63900   74.49400 1645 AAK

  37.93040   58.11890  678 ABKT

  51.88370 -176.68440  116 ADK
  etc.
  \end{verbatim}}

\noindent The function  {\color{blue}open()} has some bells and whistles to it and has the form  {\color{blue}open(name[, mode[, buffering])} where the stuff in square brackets is optional.  The `name' argument is the file name to open and `mode' is the way in which it should be opened, most commonly for reading 'r', writing 'w' or appending 'a'. We use the form 'rU' for unformatted reading because we often want to read in files that were saved in Dos, Mac OR Unix line endings and 'rU' figures all that out for you.  Just in case you are curious, Unix lines end in '$\backslash$n',  Mac files in '$\backslash$r' and Dos (and windows) lines end in '$\backslash$r$\backslash$n'.    we never use the 'buffering' argument and don't know what it does.

If you are curious about the line endings, try typing out the `representation' of the line {\color{blue}repr(line)} in the above script and you get all the  stuff that is normally  invisible like the apostrophes and the line terminations:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ReadStations.py
'   9.02920   38.76560 2442 AAE \n'
'  42.63900   74.49400 1645 AAK \n'
'  37.93040   58.11890  678 ABKT\n'
'  51.88370 -176.68440  116 ADK \n'
' -13.90930 -171.77730  706 AFI \n'
etc.
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent Notice how in our first version, printing the line also printed the line feed ($\backslash$n) as an extra line.  To clean this off of each line, we can use the  string {\color{blue}strip()} function:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
    print line.strip('\n')
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent Putting this into the code results in this behavior:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ReadStations.py
   9.02920   38.76560 2442 AAE
  42.63900   74.49400 1645 AAK
  37.93040   58.11890  678 ABKT
\end{verbatim}}


Let's say you want to read in the data table into lists called Lats, Lons, and StaIDs (the first three columns).  You need to split each line into its columns and append the correct column into the appropriate list.  Some languages automatically split on the spaces  but Python reads in the entire line as a string and ignores the spaces or other possible delimiters (commas, semi-colons, tabs, etc.).  To split the line, we use the string function {\color{blue}split([sep])} where {\color{blue}[sep]} is an optional separator.  If no separator is specified (e.g., {\color{blue}line.split()}), it will split on spaces.   Anything could be a separator, but the most common ones are ',', ';', and '$\backslash$t'.  The latter is how a tab appears if you were to, say, print out the representation of the line, which shows all the invisibles.

Here is a slightly modified version of {\color{blue}ReadStations.py}, {\color{blue}ParseStations.py} which parses out the lines and puts numbers (floats or integers) in the right lists:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
Lats,Lons,StaIDs,StaName=[],[],[] ,[]# creates lists to put things in
StationNFO=open('station.list').readlines() # combines the open and readlines methods!
for line  in StationNFO:
    nfo=line.strip('\n').split() # strips off the line ending and splits on spaces
    Lats.append(float(nfo[0])) # puts float of 1st column into Lats
    Lons.append(float(nfo[1]))# puts float of 2nd column into Lons
    StaIDs.append(int(nfo[2])) # puts integer of 3rd column into StaIDs
    StaName.append(nfo[3])# puts the ID string into StaName
    print Lats[-1],Lons[-1],StaIDs[-1] # prints out last thing appended
\end{verbatim}}

 \subsubsection{From  Standard Input }

Python can also read from \href{#standard_IO}{standard input}.  To do this, we need a system specific module, called {\color{blue}sys} which among other things has a {\color{blue}stdin} method.  So, instead of specifying a file name in the {\color{blue}open} command, we could substitute the following line:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
Lats,Lons,StaIDs,StaName=[],[],[] ,[]# creates lists to put things in
StationNFO=sys.stdin.readlines() # reads from standard input
for line  in StationNFO:
    nfo=line.strip('\n').split() # strips off the line ending and splits on spaces
    Lats.append(float(nfo[0])) # puts float of 1st column into Lats
    Lons.append(float(nfo[1]))# puts float of 2nd column into Lons
    StaIDs.append(int(nfo[2])) # puts integer of 3rd column into StaIDs
    StaName.append(nfo[3])# puts the ID string into StaName
    print Lats[-1],Lons[-1],StaIDs[-1] # prints out last thing appended
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent The program can be invoked with:

{\color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
$ ReadStations.py < station.list
\end{verbatim}}

We could also use command line switches by reading in arguments from the command line.  In the following example, we use the switch '-f' with the following argument begin the file name:

\subsubsection{Command line switches}

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
Lats,Lons,StaIDs,StaName=[],[],[] ,[]# creates lists to put things in
if '-f' in sys.argv:  # look in list of command line arguments
    file=sys.argv[sys.argv.index('-f')+1] # find index of '-f' and increment by one
StationNFO=open(file,'rU').readlines() # open file
for line  in StationNFO:
    nfo=line.strip('\n').split() # strips off the line ending and splits on spaces
    Lats.append(float(nfo[0])) # puts float of 1st column into Lats
    Lons.append(float(nfo[1]))# puts float of 2nd column into Lons
    StaIDs.append(int(nfo[2])) # puts integer of 3rd column into StaIDs
    StaName.append(nfo[3])# puts the ID string into StaName
    print Lats[-1],Lons[-1],StaIDs[-1] # prints out last thing appended
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent This version can be invoked with:

{\color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
$ ReadStations.py -f  station.list
\end{verbatim}}

\subsubsection{Reading numeric files}

In the special case where the data in a file are entirely numeric, you can read in the file with a special {\color{blue}numpy} function {\color{blue}loadtxt()}.  This reads the data into a list whereby each element of the list is a list of numbers from each line.

 \subsubsection{Writing data out}

Let's say we  have a Python module that will convert latitudes and longitudes to UTM coordinates.  O.K. We really do have one that we downloaded from here:

\url{http://code.google.com/p/pyproj/issues/attachmentText?id=27\&aid=-80884174771817564 \&name=UTM.py\&token=46ab62caa041c3f240ca0e55b7b25ad6}

\noindent We wrote a script ({\color{blue}ConvertStations.py}) to convert each of the stations in my list to their UTM equivalents (assuming these were in a WGS-84 ellipsoid).  It would be nice if  after having done this to the data, we could then write it out somehow, preferably to a file.  Of course we could use the {\color{blue}print} command like this:


 { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import UTM # imports the UTM module
Ellipsoid=23-1 # UTMs code for WGS-84
StationNFO=open('station.list').readlines()
for line  in StationNFO:
    nfo=line.strip('\n').split()
    lat=float(nfo[0])
    lon=float(nfo[1])
    StaName= nfo[3]
    Zone,Easting, Northing=UTM.LLtoUTM(Ellipsoid,lon,lat)
    print StaName, ': ', Easting, Northing, Zone
 \end{verbatim}}

\noindent
which spits out something like this:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ConvertStations.py
AAE :  474238.170087 998088.469113 37P
AAK :  458516.115522 4720850.45385 43T
ABKT :  598330.712671 4198681.92944 40S
ADK :  521722.179764 5748148.625 1U
AFI :  416023.683618 8462168.07766 2L
etc.
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
I could save the output with a UNIX re-direct:
 { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
ConvertStations.py > mynewfile
 \end{verbatim}}

But we yearn for more.  So,  more  elegantly, we can open an output file [for appending `a' or (over)writing 'w']  write a formatted string using the write method on  the output file object with format string:

 { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import UTM # imports the UTM module
outfile=open('mynewfile','w') # creates outfile object
Ellipsoid=23-1 # UTMs code for WGS-84
StationNFO=open('station.list').readlines()
for line  in StationNFO:
    nfo=line.strip('\n').split()
    lat=float(nfo[0])
    lon=float(nfo[1])
    StaName= nfo[3]
    Zone,Easting, Northing=UTM.LLtoUTM(Ellipsoid,lon,lat)
    outfile.write('%s  %s  %s  %s\n'%(StaName, Easting, Northing, Zone))
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
The only significant changes are 1) the object {\color{blue}outfile} is opened for writing. Note that this will clobber anything in a pre-existing file by that name and 2) the output file gets written to in the statement with a write method on the output file object:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
    outfile.write('%s  %s  %s  %s\n'%(StaName, Easting, Northing, Zone))
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
The write statement uses the syntax:  'format string'\%(list of variables tuple).  Format strings have these rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item For each variable in (what you...) you need a format:  \%s for string, \%i for integer, \%f for float, \%e for exponent
\item you can also specify further, e.g.:
\%7.1f  for 7 characters with 1 after the decimal
\%10.3e for 10 characters with 3 after the decimal
\item where the number of characters include the decimal and padded spaces
\item As noted before, the format string can include punctuation:
\end{itemize}
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
x,y=4.82,2.3e3
print '%7.1f,%s\t%10.3e'%(x,'hi there',y)
   4.8,hi there  2.300e+03
\end{verbatim}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the {\color{blue}ConvertStations2.py} script, the  '$\backslash$n' string puts a UNIX line ending on it.  Without that, the whole file is but a single line (very annoying).
\end{itemize}




\noindent A session using the script ({\color{blue}ConvertStations2.py} and a peek at the resulting file could look like this:
{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ ConvertStations2.py
$ head mynewfile

\section{Functions}

So far you have learned how to use functions from program modules like {\color{blue}NumPy}.  You can imagine that there are many bits of code that you might write that you will want to use again and again, say converting between degrees and radians and back, or finding the great circle distance between two points on Earth, or converting between UTM and latitude/longitude coordinates (as in {\color{blue}UTM.py}, my new favorite package).      The basic structure of a program with a  Python function is:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python

def FUNCNAME(in_args):
    ``````
    DOC STRING
    ``````
    some code that the functions does something
    return out_args

FUNCNAME(in_args) # this calls the function
\end{verbatim}}



\subsubsection{Line by line analysis}
\subsubsection{def FUNCNAME(in\_args):}

\noindent The first line must have 'def' as the first three letters, must have a function name with parentheses and a terminal colon.  If you want to pass some variables to the function, they go where  in\_arg sits, separated by commas.  There are no output variables here.

 There are four different ways to handle argument passing.

 1) You could have a function that doesn't  need any arguments at all:

 { \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
 #!/usr/bin/env python
def gimmepi():
    ``````
    returns pi
    ``````
    return 3.141592653589793
print gimmepi()
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent 2)  You could use  a set list of what are called `formal' variables that must be passed:


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
def deg2rad(degrees):
    ``````
    converts degrees to radians
    ``````
    return degrees*3.141592653589793/180.
print '42 degrees in radians is: ',deg2rad(42.)
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent 3) You could have a more flexible need for variables.  You signal this by putting  *args in the in\_args list (along with any formal variables you want):

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
def print_args(*args):
    ``````
    prints argument list
    ``````
    print 'You sent me these arguments: '
    for arg in args:
        print arg
print_args(1,4,'hi there')
print_args(42)
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent 4) You can use a keyworded, variable-length list by putting **kwargs in for in\_args:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
def print_kwargs(**kwargs):
    ``````
    prints keyworded argument list
    ``````
    for key in kwargs:
        print '%s  %s' %(key, kwargs[key])

print_kwargs(arg1='one',arg2=42,arg3='ocelot')
\end{verbatim}}

 \subsubsection{Doc String}
 Although you can certainly write functional code without a document string, make a habit of always including one.  Trust me - you'll be glad you did.  This can later be used to remind you of what you thought you were doing years later.  It can be used to print out a help message by the calling program and it also let's others know what you intended.   Notice the use of the triple quotes before and after the documentation string - that means that you can write as many lines as you want.

 \subsubsection{Function body}
 This part of the code must be indented, just like in a for loop, or other block of code.

 \subsubsection{Return statement}
 You don't need this unless you want to pass back information to the calling body (see, for example {\color{blue}print\_kwargs()} above).  Python separates the entrance and the exit.  See how it can be done in the {\color{blue}gimme\_pi()} example above.

 \subsubsection{Main program as function}

 It is considered good Python style to treat your main program block as a function too.  (This helps with using the document string as a help function and building program documentation in general.)  In any case, we recommend that you just start doing it that way too.  In this case,  we have to call the main program with the final (not indented) line {\color{blue}main()}:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
def print_kwargs(**kwargs):
    ``````
    prints keyworded argument list
    ``````
    for key in kwargs:
        print '%s  %s' %(key, kwargs[key])

def main():
    ``````
    calls function print_kwargs
    ``````
    print_kwargs(arg1='one',arg2=42,arg3='ocelot')
main()  # runs the main program
\end{verbatim}}

Notice how in the above examples, all the functions preceded the main function.  This is because Python is an interpreter and not compiled - so it won't know about anything declared below as it goes through the script line by line.   On the other hand, we've been running lots of functions and they were not in the program we used to call them.  The trick here is that
you can put a bunch of functions in a separate file (in your path) and import it, just like we did with {\color{blue}NumPy}.  Your functions can then be called from within your program  in the same way as for {\color{blue}NumPy}.

So let's say we put all the above functions in a file called {\color{blue}myfuncs.py}:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
def gimmepi():
    ``````
    returns pi
    ``````
    return 3.141592653589793
def deg2rad(degrees):
    ``````
    converts degrees to radians
    ``````
    return degrees*3.141592653589793/180.
def print_args(*args):
    ``````
    prints argument list
    ``````
    print 'You sent me these arguments: '
    for arg in args:
        print arg
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent We could then just import the module {\color{blue}myfuncs} from within another program, or just interactively. We can use the functions, or just call for help:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
$ python
>>> import myfuncs
>>> print myfuncs.gimmepi()
3.14159265359
>>> print myfuncs.print_args.__doc__

    prints argument list

>>>
\end{verbatim}}

\subsubsection{Scope of variables}

Inside a function,  variable names have their own meaning  which in many cases will be different from inside the calling function.  So,  variables names declared inside a function stay in the function.  This is true unless you declare them to be ``global''.
Here is an example in which the main program  ``knows'' about the functions variable {\color{blue}V}:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
def myfunc():
    global V
    V=123
def main():
    myfunc()
    print V
main()
\end{verbatim}}







In addition to being able to write your own functions, of course
Python has LOTS of modules and a gazzillion functions. The enthought distribution that you are using
Includes plotting, numerical recipes, trig functions, image manipulation, animation,  and many more.



\section{Classes}

Before we go any further, we need to learn some basic concepts about classes. These
 are the basis of  ``object oriented programming'' OOP (that again!).   Class objects lie behind plotting, for example and a rudimentary understanding of what they are and how they work will come in handy when we start doing anything but the simplest plotting exercises.

  A class object is   created by a call  to a ``class definition''  which which can be thought of as a blueprint for the class object.  Here is an simple example of a class definition:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
class Circle:
    ``````
    This is simple example of a class
    ``````
    pi=3.141592653589793
    def __init__(self,r):
        self.r=r
    def area(self):
        return 0.5*self.pi*self.r**2
    def circumference(self):
        return 2.*pi*self.r

\end{verbatim}}

\noindent Saving this class in a file called {\color{blue}Shapes.py} we can use it in a Python session in a manner similar to function modules:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
>>> import Shapes # import the class
>>> r=4.0
>>> C=Shapes.Circle(r) # create a class instance with r=4.
>>> C.pi  # retrieve an attribute
3.141592653589793
>>> C.area() # retrieve a method
25.132741228718345
>>> C.r=2.0 # change the value of r
>>> C.area() # get a new area
6.283185307179586
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent In spite of superficial similarities, classes are not the same as functions.  Although the Shape module is imported just the same as any other, to use it, we first have to create a class ``instance'' ({\color{blue}C=Shapes.Circle(r)}).  {\color{blue}C} is an object with  ``attributes'' (variables) and ``methods''.
All methods (parts that start with ``def''),  have an argument list. The first argument has to be a reference to the class instance itself, or ``self'', followed by any variables you want to pass into the method.  So the {\color{blue}\_\_init\_\_} method initializes the instance attributes of an object.  In the above case, it defined the attribute {\color{blue}r}, which gets passed in when the class is first called.
Asking for any attribute (note the lack of parentheses), retrieves the current value of that attribute.  Attributes can be changed (as in  {\color{blue}C.r=2.0}).

The other methods ({\color{blue}area} and {\color{blue}circumference}) are defined like any function except note the use of 'self' as the first argument.  This is required in all class method definitions.  In our case, no other parameters are passed in because the only one used is {\color{blue}r}, so the argument list consists of only {\color{blue}self}.  Calling these methods returns the current values of these methods.

You can make a subclass (child) of the parent class which has all the attributes and methods of the parent, but may have a few attributes and methods of its own.   You do this by setting up another class definition within a class.

So, the bottom line about classes is that they are  in the same category of things as variables, lists, dictionaries, etc. That is, they are  `data structures' - they hold data, and the methods to process that data.
If you are curious about classes, there's lots more to know about classes that we don't have time to get into, but you can find useful tutorials online:

 (e.g., \url{http://www.sthurlow.com/python/lesson08/})



\customlink{matplotlib}
\section{Matplotlib}

So far you have learned the basics of Python, and NumPy.  But Python was sold as a way of visualizing data and we haven't yet seen a single plot (except a stupid one in the beginning). There are many plotting options within the Python umbrella. The most mature and the one we am most familiar with is {\color{blue}matplotlib}, a popular  graphics module of Python.
Actually  {\color{blue}matplotlib} is a collection of a bunch of other modules, toolkits, methods and  classes.   For a fairly complete and readable tour of matplotlib, check out these links:

\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/Matplotlib.pdf}

\noindent
and here:

\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}




\subsubsection{A first plot}

Let's start by reviewing the   simple plot script ({\color{blue}matplotlib1.py}):


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``) # my favorite backend
import pylab # module with matplotlib
pylab.plot([1,2,3])  # plot some numbers
pylab.ylabel('Y') # label the y-axis
pylab.show() # reveal the plot
\end{verbatim}}



The first step should be obvious by now, it imports {\color{blue}matplotlib}.
Figures are rendered on ``backends'' so they appear on screen.  There are a lot of different back-ends with slightly different looks.  Some work better on different operating systems. We use the very old school backend called  ``TkAgg'' backend because it ``works''.  So step 2  sets the backend: {\color{blue}matplotlib.use(``TkAgg'')}.  The module {\color{blue}matplotlib} itself contains a lot of other modules.  One of these,
{\color{blue}pylab} is the ``business end'' that has a lot of plotting methods and classes.  It must be  loaded alongside {\color{blue}matplotlib},   so step 3 is:  {\color{blue}import pylab}. After that the fun starts.

In the above example, we call the {\color{blue}plot} method with a list as an argument.  As we mentioned, {\color{blue}matplotlib} uses the concept of ``classes'' to make plots and this has just happened behind the scenes. We could have named the plot instance with a the {\color{blue}figure()} method (e.g.,  {\color{blue}fig=pylab.figure()}) and then referred to it later with the command  {\color{blue}fig.plot([1,2,3])}, but we don't have to in this simple case - the class instance is implied and is the ``current plot''.  You can tell this, if you do the above example in interactive mode:

{ \color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
>>> import matplotlib
>>> matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
>>> import pylab
>>> pylab.plot([1,2,3])
[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x4bd6eb0>]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent The bit about {\color{blue}[$<$matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x4bd6eb0$>$]} is Python's way of telling you that you just created an object and something about it.
In any case, when you give {\color{blue} plot()} a single sequence of values (as above), it assumes they are $y$ values and supplies the $x$ values for you.

Attributes of the {\color{blue}pylab} class, such as the Y axis label can be changes with the {\color{blue}ylabel} method.  As you can imagine, there are LOTS of methods, including, surprise, an {\color{blue}xlabel} method.

When we are done customizing the plot instance, we can view it with the {\color{blue}show} method.  When that gets executed, we will get a plot something like this:

   \includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/matplotlib1.eps}

   \noindent Once that happens, we won't be able to change the plot any more and in fact, we won't get our terminal back until the little plot window is closed.   You can save your plot with the little disk icon in a variety of formats.  Adobe Illustrator likes .svg, or .eps while Microsoft products like .png file formats.

If you find it annoying to always have to close figures with the little red button, or save them with the disk icon, you can tweak the program like this:

{ \color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
import pylab
pylab.ion()  # turn on interactivity
pylab.plot([1,2,3])
pylab.ylabel('Y')
pylab.draw() # draw  the current plot
ans=raw_input('press [s] to save figure, any other key to quit: ')
if ans=='s':
    pylab.savefig('myfig.eps')
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent The method {\color{blue}pylab.savefig(FILENAME.FMT)}.  The .FMT can be one of several, e.g., .eps, .svg, .ps, .pdf, .png, .gif, .jpg, etc.).   Some of these (the vector graphics ones like pdf,  ps, eps and svg) can be opened in Adobe Illustrator for modification.


As mentioned earlier, if  you give {\color{blue}plot()} a single sequence of values, it assumes they are $y$ values and supplies the $x$ values for you.  Garbage in, garbage out.  But
 {\color{blue}plot()} takes an arbitrary number of arguments of the form: ($X_1, Y_1$, line\_style\_1, $X_2, Y_2$, line\_style\_2,  etc.),
 where 'line\_style' is a string that specifies the line style as illustrated in this script called {\color{blue}matplotlib2.py}


{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
import pylab,numpy
x=numpy.arange(0,360,10)
r=x*numpy.pi/180.
c=numpy.cos(r)
s=numpy.sin(r)
pylab.plot(x,c,'r--',x,s,'g^')
pylab.show()
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent which produces the plot:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/matplotlib2.eps}

\noindent   From the code, you can probably figure out that a line style of 'r--' is a red dashed line,  and 'g\verb|^|'  are green triangles.
There are many other attributes that can be controlled: linewidth, dash style, etc. and we invite you to check out the {\color{blue}matplotlib} documentation.

\noindent By now, you should understand enough about classes, keyword argument passing and other pythonalia to be able to figure things out on your own.   But don't panic, I'm going to lead you through a few more examples, which we hope will speed you on your plotting way.



\subsubsection{Multiple figures and more customization}
As already mentioned,  {\color{blue}pylab} has the concept of ``current figure'' which subsequent commands refer to.   In the preceding examples, we only had one figure, so we didn't have to name it, but for fancier figures with several plots, we
can create  named figure objects by invoking a {\color{blue}figure} instance:

 {\color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
fig = pylab.figure(num=1,figsize=(5,7)).
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent  Notice the syntax whereby {\color{blue} figsize}  is a method with  width and height (in inches) specified by a tuple and {\color{blue}num}  is the figure number.    Notice that these are keyword arguments, and that there are many more:  consult the list of  **kwargs in the online documentation  located here:

\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.figure }

Once we have a figure instance (sometimes called a ``container''), we can do all kinds of things, including adding subplots.  To do this, we can use the syntax:

{\color{blue}\begin{verbatim}
 fig.add_subplot(211)
 \end{verbatim}}
 \noindent Here the
argument  211 means 2 rows, one column and this is the first plot.  To make plots side by side, you would use: {\color{blue} fig.add\_subplot(121) } for  1 row, two columns, etc.

After each {\color{blue}add\_subplot} command, that subplot becomes the current figure for plotting on.
If you want more freedom, say, you want to make a subplot at an arbitrary place,  use the {\color{blue}add\_axes([left, bottom,width, height])} 0 method, e.g.,  {{\color{blue}add\_axes([0.1,0.1,0.7,0.3])}.  The values are 0-1 in relative figure coordinates.

To illustrate these new concepts, consider the example code, {\color{blue}matplotlib3.py}:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
import pylab, numpy
def f(t):
    return numpy.exp(-t)*numpy.cos(2.*numpy.pi*t)
t1= numpy.arange(0.,5.,0.1)
t2= numpy.arange(0.,5.,0.02)
fig=pylab.figure(num=1,figsize=(7,5))
fig.add_subplot(211)
pylab.plot(t1,f(t1),'bo')
pylab.plot(t1,f(t1),'k-')
fig.add_subplot(212)
pylab.plot(t2,numpy.cos(2*numpy.pi*t2),'r--')
pylab.xlabel('Time (ms)')
fig.add_axes([.6,.75,.25,.10])
pylab.plot([0,1],[0,1],'r-',[0,1],[1,0],'r-')
pylab.ylabel('Inset')
pylab.show()
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent which produces:

{\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/matplotlib3.eps}}

\noindent By now, you should be able to figure out what everything in that script does by yourself!

\subsubsection{Adding text}

We already met {\color{blue}xlabel} and {{\color{blue}ylabel}.  But text can be added in a other ways, e.g., using the  title, text, legend and arrow methods.
Let's decorate one of our early examples to show how some of these things work:

{ \color{blue} \begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use(``TkAgg``)
import pylab,numpy
x=numpy.arange(0,360,10)
r=x*numpy.pi/180.
c=numpy.cos(r)
s=numpy.sin(r)
s2=numpy.sin(r)**2
pylab.plot(x,c,'r--',x,s,'g^',x,s2,'k-')
pylab.title('Fun with trig')
pylab.text(250,-.5,'pithy note')
pylab.legend(['cos(x)',\
    'sin(x)',r'$\sin(x^2$)'],'lower left')
pylab.xlabel(r'$\theta')
pylab.annotate('triangles!',\
  xy=(175,0),xytext=(110,-.25),\
   arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black',\
   shrink=0.05))
pylab.show()
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent which produces this plot:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/matplotlib4.eps}

The title appears at the top of the plot.
    Text labels get places at the $x$ and $y$ coordinates on the plot and the legend will appear in the upper/lower right/left corner as specified in the string.  The {\color{blue}pylab.text(x,y,string, kwargs)} method also has optional key word arguments, specifying font, size, color and the like.     The legend 'labelist' is a list of labels for each plot element.  So, every line or point style that you want in your legend, append a label to the label list after the relevant plot command. Also note that the legend and xlabel methods use  a special format for strings ({\color{blue}r'LateX String')} which allows embedded LaTeX equation syntax  to make scientific equations look right - so now you have to learn LaTeX!.   Finally, the arrow gets drawn with the {\color{blue}annotate} method, which has a lot of other attributes as well.
Check the {\color{blue}matplotlib} documentation for details.





There are lots of graphing styles possible with {\color{blue}matplotlib}, e.g., histograms, pie charts, contour plots, whisker plots, etc.  I'm just going to show you a few examples.  The best thing to do is to look through the online documentation for a plot that looks like what you need, then modify it.  This is ALWAYS a good approach - start with something that works and fiddle with it until it suits your own particular needs.

\chapter{Jupyter Notebooks}

Data analysis in Python benefits from an increasingly robust ecosystem of packages for scientific computing and plotting. A tool that has gained increasingly widespread use for conducting and presenting data analysis is the Jupyter notebook. The Jupyter notebook builds on the IPython project which began as a way to bring increased interactivity to data analysis in Python \citep{perez07} and has evolved to include an interactive notebook environment that seeks to enable the full trajectory of scientific computing from initial analysis and visualization onwards to collaboration and through to publication. The project has expanded to enable a reproducible interactive computing environment for many other programming languages (such as R and Julia) and the language-agnostic parts of its architecture have recently been rebranded as Project Jupyter (\url{http://jupyter.org}). Jupyter notebooks allow for executable code, results, text and graphical output to coherently coexist in a single document. With these combined components, they are excellent tools both for conducting data analysis and presenting results.

Underlying the {\bf PmagPy}  programs that are accessible through the command line and the GUI interfaces (e.g., {\bf Pmag GUI}) are two main function libraries: {\bf pmag.py} and {\bf pmagplotlib.py}. The functions within these modules can  be imported and called upon within a Jupyter notebook running a Python 2.7 kernel. In addition to these functions, Nick Swanson-Hysell created a module called {\bf ipmag.py} that is in active development and contains functions that replicate and extend functionality that is found within the {\bf PmagPy}  command line programs for use in the notebook environment.

To show some of what is possible in terms of data analysis using {\bf PmagPy} in a notebook environment, we have created example notebooks that are available for download from this repository: \url{https://github.com/PmagPy/2016_Tauxe-et-al_PmagPy_Notebooks}. These notebooks can also be viewed as static webpages here: \url{http://pmagpy.github.io/Example_PmagPy_Notebook.html} and \url{http://pmagpy.github.io/Additional_PmagPy_Examples.html}.

The main example notebook (Example\_PmagPy\_Notebook.ipynb) combines data from two different studies for the sake of developing a mean paleomagnetic pole from the upper portion of a sequence of volcanics in the North American Midcontinent Rift \citep{halls74, swansonhysell14}.  The two data files used within the notebook can be downloaded from the MagIC database. The digital object identifier (doi) search option allows for the data files to be readily located as  \url{https://earthref.org/MagIC/doi/10.1139/e74-113/} and \url{https://earthref.org/MagIC/doi/10.1002/2013GC005180/}. Downloading these data files from the database and putting them into folders within a local `Project Directory' allows them to be accessed within the Jupyter notebook. Within the notebook, these data are unpacked into their respective MagIC formatted tab delimited data files. The data are then loaded into dataframes and filtered using several different criteria (stratigraphic height and polarity).  Several functions from the {\bf ipmag} module are used for making equal area projections and calculating statistics. In addition to combining the data sets to calculate the mean pole, the code in the notebook conducts a bootstrap fold test on the data using the approach of \cite{tauxe94} as well as a common mean test. The data recombinations and calculations done in this notebook are examples of portions of the data analysis workflow which are often difficult to document and reproduce. The examples illustrate a small sliver of the potential for the use of notebooks for data manipulation and analysis of paleomagnetic data. Additional functionality available within PmagPy is demonstrated within the additional {\bf PmagPy} examples notebook (Additional\_PmagPy\_Examples.ipynb) as small vignettes of example code. Functions related to paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data analysis are shown as examples. The notebook also illustrates some of the interactivity that can be built into the notebook utilizing IPython widgets.

To execute and edit notebook code yourself, you can clone or download this repository: \url{https://github.com/PmagPy/2016_Tauxe-et-al_PmagPy_Notebooks}.  If you installed the Enthought Canopy or Anaconda Python distribution you will have the IPython and Jupyter packages installed. If you have another Python distribution you will want to make sure that you have IPython and Jupyter (installation instructions can currently be found here: \url{http://ipython.org/install.html} and here: \url{http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html}). To view and edit the notebooks,  type {\bf ipython notebook} or {\bf jupyter notebook} on the \href{#command_line}{command line}.  This command will open up a local IPython server in your default web browser within which you can use the directory to navigate to the data\_files folder. Click on it to open and edit. You will see something like this:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/notebook.eps}

Notebooks are constructed as a series of `cells' which can be text or code.  To view the `source' of a text cell, just click on it.  To render it, click on the `run' button (sideways triangle on the toolbar).  Similarly, to run the code in a code cell, click on the cell and then the `run' button (or use the shift+enter short cut).   To execute the entire notebook, click on the `Cell' button and choose 'Run All'.

To use {\bf PmagPy} within the notebook, the {\bf PmagPy} function modules need to be in your Python path. This . There are two ways to do this. One way is to have your .profile or .bash\_profile have a line in it that reads :

\begin{verbatim}
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/PmagPy
\end{verbatim}

Another way is to set the path to the location of your PmagPy folder within the notebook itself. The default location on  MacOS is in a folder called {\it PmagPy} in your home directory (e.g., /Users/YOUR\_NAME\_HERE/PmagPy) and on Windows is in the Documents folder (e.g., 'C:\\Users\\YOUR\_NAME\_HERE\\Documents\\PmagPy\\PmagPy'. To do this you must \texttt{import os} and then have a line that reads \texttt{sys.path.insert(0, `/Users/......')} where the path reflects your own path.   If PmagPy is in your path you should be able to run the first code block which imports the {\bf PmagPy} modules and makes them availible available to use within the notebook.  The notebooks also import several other Python modules useful for scientific computing (numpy),  data manipulation (pandas) and plotting (matplotlib).

 Now you are ready to look at some data.  In the code block under the heading `Reading data from MagIC format results files',  data are read in from a file \href{#magic_download}{downloaded} and unpacked from the MagIC database.   The notebook shows how to read in the data into a \href{#pandas}{pandas DataFrame}, and plot the directions on an equal area projection:

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{EPSfiles/SnakeRiver.eps}

There are several other tricks shown off in the notebook, which should be enough to get you started using {\bf ipmag} in a Python notebook environment.  Conducting data analysis  using {\bf PmagPy} in a notebook allows for the underlying code of statistical tests to be available and for the decisions made in the specific implementation of such tests to be transparently presented.

Although there is much much more to do in Python, this documentation is aimed at getting and using {\bf PmagPy}, so that's it for this chapter. Congratulations if you made it to the end!

\chapter{Troubleshooting}
\label{chap:trouble}

\section{Problems with installing Python or PmagPy}

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Nothing works as advertised!


  \begin{itemize}

 \item First, please test that you have successfully installed the appropriate Python distribution.

 \item For Mac users, find your command line (Terminal) and type ``python".  You should see something like this:


\begin{verbatim}$ python
Enthought Canopy Python 2.7.6 | 64-bit | (default, Jun  4 2014, 16:42:26)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
\end{verbatim}



\item For windows users, find your command line (Command Prompt), and type ``python''.  You should see something like this:

\begin{verbatim}$ python
Enthought Python Distribution -- www.enthought.com
Version: 7.3-2 (32-bit)

Python 2.7.3 |EPD 7.3-2 (32-bit)| (default, Apr 12 2012, 11:28:34)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] on darwin
Type ``credits", ``demo" or ``enthought" for more information.
>>>
\end{verbatim}

\item If you don't see one of the above messages, you have not fully installed the Python distribution.  You'll need to try again.  For Mac users, in order to complete the install you must start Canopy (it will be in Applications) and select ``yes'' to use Canopy Python as your default Python.  For Windows users, you should be prompted during the install process to make Enthought Python your default Python, and you need to select yes.

\end{itemize}


\item I've installed the proper Python distribution, but PmagPy doesn't work

\begin{itemize}

\item For Mac users:


When you try to run eqarea.py -h to test your installation, you get this error message:

\begin{verbatim} -bash: eqarea.py: command not found
\end{verbatim}

There are a few possible reasons for this failure, the most common of which is that your path has not been correctly set.  To test this, type ``echo \$PATH" in your command line.

You will see something like this:\\
%\begin{verbatim}

/Users/****/Library/Enthought/Canopy\_64bit/User/bin: /usr/local/bin: /usr/local/share/npm/bin: /usr/bin: /bin: /usr/sbin: /sbin: /usr/local/bin: /opt/X11/bin: /Users/****/PmagPy:/usr/texbin\\
%\end{verbatim}

Your \$PATH may look very different, but as long as you have the complete path to the PmagPy directory in there, you are golden.  If the directory is not in your path, you can try re-running the PmagPy install script, which should set your path correctly  for you.  If that doesn't work, go to your home directory (to get there, type ``cd" in your command line).  Use a text editor to open a file called .bash\_profile and add these lines:

\begin{verbatim}export PATH=/Users/***/PmagPy:$PATH\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}export PATH=/Users/***/PmagPy/programs:$PATH\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/***/PmagPy/\end{verbatim}

where *** is your username.  Then restart your Terminal.  If it still doesn't work, see question 3.


\item For Windows users:

\begin{verbatim} "eqarea.py" is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
\end{verbatim}

Setting your path should not be an issue in Windows if you are using the PmagPy prompt (created by the install script).  PmagPy functionality will be available only in the custom Command Prompt, so make sure you are using it.  However, if you do need to set your path for some reason, see:

\href{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/94933-how-do-i-set-my-system-path-under-windows}{Setting your Path in Windows}

If you are using the \href{#full_pip}{pip install} instead of the PmagPy prompt, you'll need to use the command ``eqarea -h'', \textbf{not} ``eqarea.py -h''.  This is caused by a strange Windows quirk, but all you need to know is this: anytime the Cookbook gives a command, you'll need to drop the ``.py'' and all will be well.

\end {itemize}

\item  My path is correctly set, but I still get this error message: \begin{verbatim} -bash: eqarea.py: command not found
\end{verbatim}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item  For Mac users, it is possible that you need to make the python scripts executable. On the command line in the directory with the scripts, type: chmod a+x *.py
  \end{itemize}

\item
  If you are using the pip installation of PmagPy and you have any problems, you should start by uninstalling and reinstalling pmagpy and pmagpy-cli.  To do this, use these commands:
\begin{verbatim}

pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pmagpy
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pmagpy-cli
\end{verbatim}
To test that they have installed properly, you can run the command:
\begin{verbatim}
pip list
\end{verbatim}
which will show you all of your pip-installed packages.  If you don't see pmagpy and pmagpy-cli, you'll need to install them.

\item
  If your computer uses multiple languages, or a language other than English, you may get an error message like this:
  \begin{verbatim}

  File ``/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.7.4.3348.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py'', line 17, in __enter__
  return self.gen.next()
  File ``/Users/***/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py'', line 1000, in _open_file_or_url
  encoding = locale.getdefaultlocale()[1]
  File ``/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.7.4.3348.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7/locale.py'', line 543, in getdefaultlocale
  return _parse_localename(localename)
  File ``/Applications/Canopy.app/appdata/canopy-1.7.4.3348.macosx-x86_64/Canopy.app/Contents/lib/python2.7/locale.py'', line 475, in _parse_localename
  raise ValueError, 'unknown locale: %s' % localename
  ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
  \end{verbatim}
  You can fix this by opening your .bashrc file and adding these lines:
  \begin{verbatim}
  export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
  export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
  \end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Problems updating Canopy}
If you are using Canopy (not just EPD), you will need to keep it up to date.  Currently, that means the version number should be 1.6.1 or higher.  In general, you can update by opening the Canopy application; it will automatically check for updates.  However, if you haven't updated for a long time, Canopy can get ``stuck'' in an old version where it can no longer update.  If that is the case, you will need to fully uninstall and reinstall canopy, following the directions on the \href{https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469570-Canopy-shows-no-updates-available-reinstalling-from-the-website}{Enthought website}.

\section{Error loading dlls (windows only)}
Some of the modules used in PmagPy have dependencies that are not called directly.  If you are missing one of those dependencies, the programs may fail in odd ways.  In general, it is worthwhile to open Canopy, go into the package manager, and update all packages.  More specifically, if you see an error message like this: \begin{verbatim}ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found  \end{verbatim} you may be missing the MKL package.  Open Canopy, go to package manager, and select ``Available packages".  Scroll down to MKL, and install it.  This should fix the problem!  Note that windows users who are having trouble opening one of the GUIs should try this solution whether or not they actually see this error message.


\section{Problems with a specific program}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thellier auto\_interpreter crashes with a Segmentation Fault (on Mac).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This error is caused by a version issue with one of PmagPy's dependencies, matplotlib.  There are two ways to solve this problem.
  \item Recommended: download and use the \href{#standalone}{standalone Pmag GUI} distribution to access Thellier GUI.
  \item Alternative: open the Canopy application, and navigate to the Canopy Package Manager.  Go to ``Installed packages'' and find matplotlib.  Click matplotlib's ``more info'' button.  The click ``show'' to see all versions of the package.  Select matplotlib 1.4.3-7 and install.  This will fix the segmentation error, however, it may cause the Thellier GUI menubar to behave oddly.  For this reason, we recommend the first solution (above).
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Other problems}Report a problem not listed above: e-mail \href{mailto:ltauxe@ucsd.edu}{ltauxe@ucsd.edu}. Include the following information: 1) the version of PmagPy that you are using, 2) your operating system, 3) any error messages that you got, 4) the datafile that is giving trouble, if relevant.
