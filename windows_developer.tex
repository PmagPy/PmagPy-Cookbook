\section{Windows developer install}

These are the install instructions for Windows/developer.  If this isn't your operating system, or you want a developer install, go back to the \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#next_steps}{Cookbook} and select the correct link.


\subsection{Install Python}

First, you will need to download a scientific Python distribution.  We strongly recommend Anaconda.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item Download and install \href{https://www.anaconda.com/download}{Anaconda Python 3}.  Select an install for “Just Me”, not for all users.  You should select ``Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable'' in Advanced Installation Options (if available).  Otherwise, stick with the defaults.
   \item Open your command line (Command Prompt). See \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#command_line}{this Cookbook section} for more information on finding your command line.
   \item Note: if you did not add Anaconda Python to your PATH as recommended above, you will open the ``Anaconda Prompt'' instead.
   \item Download a few non-default Python packages.  Run the following commands: \begin{verbatim}

    conda install future wxPython cartopy pandas
    conda install scripttest --channel conda-forge --no-deps
    conda install matplotlib=2.2.3
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


\end{verbatim}
   \item When running these commands you may see some warnings about dependencies, but you can just ignore them!

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test your python}

To make sure that you have installed Python successfully, type \texttt{python} on your command line.  You should see something like this: \begin{verbatim}

Python 3.6.4 |Anaconda custom (32-bit)| (default, Jan 16 2018, 10:21:59) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>\end{verbatim}
(Type ``quit()'' and then hit enter to end your python session)



\subsection{Install PmagPy}

Here are the steps to clone and install {\bf PmagPy}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Open your command prompt \href{http://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator}{as an admin} (right click on the Command Prompt icon and select ``Run as administrator'').

\item Download and \href{https://git-scm.com/downloads}{install git}

  \item Navigate to the directory where you want to put the PmagPy folder, then run:

\begin{verbatim}

  git clone https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy.git
\end{verbatim}

\item You should now have a full local copy of the PmagPy repository.  Change directories into PmagPy:

\begin{verbatim}

  cd PmagPy
\end{verbatim}


\item Next, you need to add PmagPy to your PATH so that the PmagPy programs can be called from any directory.  At present, you will have to do this manually.  This section of the Cookbook has the full instructions for \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#setting_path}{editing your PATH for PmagPy}.

\item After setting your PATH, you will need to restart the Command Prompt.  After restarting, you should be able to use all {\bf PmagPy} functionality.  You will be able to stay up-to-date with {\bf PmagPy} development and make edits in {\bf PmagPy} code which will be immediately available in your system.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test PmagPy}

Test core functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item On your command line, type ``python'' to start the interpreter.  You will import pmagpy and then run a simple calculation.  Importing pmagpy may take over a minute the first time, so be patient!  It will be much faster in subsequent runs.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from pmagpy import pmag
>>> pmag.angle([350.0,10.0],[320.0,20.0])
array([30.59060998])
>>>
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

Test the GUIs:

\begin{itemize}
\item  On the command line, open Pmag GUI by running:

\begin{verbatim}
pmag_gui.py
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

If any of these commands don't work, go back and carefully follow the install instructions.  If you still have a problem, try the \href{https://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/#trouble}{Troubleshooting section}.  If you don't find an answer there, check out the existing \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy/issues}{Github issues} and create a new one if necessary.

\subsection{Finishing up}

Accessing example data files:

   There are many data files used in the examples of programs and for use with the textbook  \href{http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3.html}{Essentials of Paleomagnetism}.  You can find these in PmagPy/data_files.

\subsection{Keeping PmagPy up-to-date}

    You will want to stay up to date with {\bf PmagPy} development.  To update your developer install, you will just need to navigate to the {\bf PmagPy} directory and run:

\begin{verbatim}
    git pull
\end{verbatim}

This will grab all of the latest code from \href{https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy}{Github}, and will be immediately available to you.
